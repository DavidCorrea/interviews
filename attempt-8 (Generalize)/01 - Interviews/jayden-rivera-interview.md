## Landing on the Homepage

Okay so I'm pulling up launchpadlab.com. My mentor said I should look at agencies, and honestly I've never really vibed with the idea of hiring an agency — feels very corporate, very "let's schedule a synergy meeting" — but I'm open. Let's see what these guys are about.

First thing I notice: the page title says "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." Alright, that's already better than most agency sites I've seen. At least they're leading with AI and not some generic "we build websites" pitch. I see the nav bar: Services, Technologies, Industries, Our Work, About Us, Insights, Contact. Pretty standard agency layout. Nothing wild, nothing bad. Clean.

### Hero Section

The hero heading hits me: **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."** Okay... it's a little buzzwordy? Like, "Results that Matter" is the kind of thing every single agency says. But the AI part — I respect that they're leading with it. The subtext says "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."

Hmm. "Organizations." "Modernize operations." "Reduce costs." This is already giving enterprise energy, ngl. Like, they're clearly talking to corporate clients, not someone like me who's trying to build a consumer app. But let me not judge too fast. There's a "Connect with an Expert" CTA — at least it's not "Request a Demo" or "Schedule a Consultation," which I find way more corporate. "Connect with an Expert" is... fine.

### Client Logos

Then there's a "Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses" section with logos: Kawasaki Engines, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, Harvard University, Prosci, Whirlpool, Northwestern University, CDK Global, Lurie Children's Hospital, Indiana University, Select Home Warranty, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Bullhorn.

Okay so these are all BIG names. Like, Harvard? Whirlpool? MD Anderson? That's impressive no cap. But also... these are all very enterprise-y or institutional clients. I don't see any startups, any consumer apps, any "we helped this founder go from zero to a million users" type energy. It's all "we helped this massive org digitize their workflows." Which is cool for them, but I'm looking for someone who understands the speed and scrappiness of building a startup.

### Strategic AI Partner Section

Next section: "Your Strategic AI Partner" with the heading **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."** There it is — "Modern Enterprise." That's their target customer. They said the quiet part loud. "We've helped hundreds of businesses across all industries solve complex problems that go beyond just ROI." Okay, the "go beyond just ROI" bit is interesting. At least they're acknowledging that it's not all about the money.

### Driving ROI with AI

Then there's a section called "Driving ROI with AI" — **"Make AI Your Competitive Advantage."** They list out their service offerings as cards:

1. **AI Automation & Agentic AI** — "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce." Yo, agentic AI? That's actually fire. I've been deep in the agentic AI discourse on Twitter. The fact that they're doing this is cool.
2. **Web Application Development** — "Bespoke, redefining experiences." Bespoke is such a boujee word but okay, they build web apps. Good.
3. **Mobile Application Development** — "Meeting users where they are." Standard but necessary.
4. **Salesforce Development** — "Solving business problems." And there's the Salesforce. Every agency has a Salesforce practice these days. I personally couldn't care less about Salesforce but I get why it's there.
5. **Product Strategy & Design** — "Agile, cross-functional expertise." This is more interesting to me — I need help thinking through product strategy, not just execution.
6. **Managed Services & Support** — "Operating as an extension of your team." Post-launch support. Makes sense.

### Problems We Solve

The next section is "Problems We Solve" — **"Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast."** Okay now THAT headline resonates. Shipping fast is literally my #1 priority. They have these tabs: Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement, Scalable Solutions, Expansive Resources, Speed to Market. The Speed to Market tab says "Ship products to market fast to beat your competition." Yes. That. That's what I need.

### Stats & Track Record

There are some stats: **12+ Years in Business, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients** — and "90% work with us for longer than one year." That's actually a strong signal. If clients keep coming back, they must be doing something right. 730 projects is a LOT. These aren't amateurs.

### Signature Approach

Then there's "Our Signature Approach" — **Discover, Deliver, Release.** It's a standard agile-ish lifecycle: Research & Define → Development with bi-weekly sprints → QA Testing → Deploy → Ongoing Support. Bi-weekly sprints and weekly demos with the client — that's legit. I like transparency in the dev process. Nothing groundbreaking about the methodology but it sounds solid and organized.

### AI Solutions CTA

There's a section called "Put AI to Work" — **"Transform how your business operates with custom AI solutions."** The copy says "The companies pulling ahead are using AI to automate repetitive work, improve decision-making, and deliver experiences their competitors can't match." I mean, yeah, no argument there.

### Homepage Case Studies Carousel

The case studies carousel shows:
- **Millennium Trust Company** — "Spurring Enterprise Innovation" — 3 new digital products, $1M+ new annual revenue
- **Prosci** — "360-Customer View in Salesforce" — 5,400+ users, 30+ countries
- **CDK Global** — "Sales Discovery Portal" — 90% reduction in training time

Cool results but again, very enterprise. I'm not seeing anything consumer-facing. No one building the next Duolingo or TikTok with these guys. It's all portals and dashboards and Salesforce integrations.

### Homepage Footer & Form

The footer has their address — **2045 W Grand Ave, Chicago, Illinois 60612** — and their phone number **(312) 888-9651**. They're a Chicago shop. They also have Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn. And they're a Salesforce Partner (of course they are).

At the very bottom of the homepage there's also an embedded contact form with fields for First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, and "How Can We Help You?" — plus a CAPTCHA iframe. Pretty standard lead gen form. They ask for "Company Email" not just "Email" which tells me they're expecting business inquiries, not randos with gmail accounts. That's a little intimidating for a solo founder tbh. I don't have a "company" company yet. I have a Notion doc and a dream.

---

## The Services Page

Alright I'm clicking into Services. The dropdown shows me all their service lines again, but I click through to the main Services page.

Hero: **"AI-Centered Digital Product Development."** Their tagline: "Our cross-functional teams have the skills and experience to support the full digital product lifecycle, using proven methods to deliver more better and faster with AI at the core." Okay the grammar on "deliver more better and faster" is a little awkward but I get what they mean.

### Services Detail

The services are listed out in more detail now:

1. **AI Automation & Agentic AI** — "Leverage AI automation capabilities and tooling to streamline operations, reduce costs, drive customer satisfaction, and enhance decision-making capabilities–faster and at scale." Still enterprise-speak but the capability is real.

2. **Web Application Development** — "Build an intuitive, user-friendly digital product that helps your team become more efficient, boost adoption, and differentiate your organization from the competition." Okay this is interesting because it's about differentiation, which is exactly what I want.

3. **Mobile Application Development** — "Deliver a world-class, mobile experience for your apps and websites, shipping to market in **50% less time** than other software development consultancies." WAIT. 50% less time? That's a big claim. I'm lowkey intrigued. If they can actually ship mobile in half the time of other agencies... that's significant for someone like me who needs to move fast.

4. **Salesforce Development** — *skimming* — yeah no, I don't care about Salesforce.

5. **Digital Product Strategy & Design** — "Bring your vision to life with a clear, human-centric product strategy and design that doesn't just look good—it drives engagement and converts." Human-centric design, conversion focus — that's more my language.

6. **Managed Services & Support** — Post-launch stuff. I'll care about this eventually but not right now.

### Problems We Solve Accordion

There's a "Problems We Solve" accordion with Business, IT, and Users perspectives. The Business tab talks about speed to market and future-proofing. The Users tab says "Enjoy a quick, modern, intuitive experience that adds value... New features drive retention, adoption, and engagement." That's consumer product thinking! I like that.

### Discovery Space Navigator

Then I see something interesting — **"Discovery Space Navigator"** — "Your 3-Step Blueprint for What to Build." They have this proprietary AI tool called **Mission Control** that helps you figure out what to build, why it matters, and where to focus for maximum ROI. The stats say: **2 Sprints to Build a Prototype, 6 Weeks or Less to Launch, 5x Faster Time to Market.**

Okay that's actually sick. 5x faster time to market? 6 weeks to launch? If that's real, that's exactly the kind of speed I need. I'm interested in this Discovery Space Navigator thing. It's like they have their own AI tool to help with product strategy. That shows they're not just talking about AI — they're using it internally too. That's a green flag.

---

## The AI Automation Page

I click into the AI Automation & Agentic AI page because this is what actually excites me.

Hero: **"Transform Business Operations with AI Automation and Agentic AI."** "AI automation and an agentic workforce remove bottlenecks with speed and scale." There's a CTA to "Book an AI Automation Assessment."

### AI Capabilities

Their AI capabilities breakdown:
- **Autonomous Automation** — AI automates repetitive, rules-based processes
- **Agentic AI Deployment** — "Train digital agents to act independently—accessing data, following logic, and escalating when needed." This is basically what I want to build into my app. Agents that can do stuff for users.
- **Integrated Data Workflows** — connecting systems for clean, actionable data
- **Business Logic Codification** — converting human knowledge into repeatable prompts and workflows. That's literally prompt engineering at scale.
- **Rapid AI Rollouts** — "From concept to launch in 6 weeks." There's that 6 weeks again.

### Agentforce Quick Start

Then there's an **Agentforce Quick Start Program** — "Build a customer-facing Agentforce and experience how AI agents will help your business get more done better and faster." This is Salesforce Agentforce specific though, which is less relevant to me. But the concept of getting an AI agent live in 6 weeks is compelling.

### Problems & Solutions Table

The "Problems We Solve" table is actually cool:
- Slow, Manual Processes → Intelligent automation
- Siloed, Disconnected Systems → Integrated AI pulling data in real time
- Inconsistent Execution → Always-on agents with consistent, rules-driven outcomes
- Limited Team Capacity → Autonomous agents that scale without adding headcount
- Low Data Visibility → Structured data pipelines for real-time decisions

Stats: **60%+ reduction in repetitive manual work, 3x faster response across service channels, 6 weeks to deploy.** Those are solid numbers if legit.

### AI Engagement Approach

Their approach for AI:
1. **AI Opportunity Workshop** (Free!) — one session to identify pain points
2. **Proof of Concept** (3-4 weeks) — build and test a real AI solution
3. **Production Deployment** (2-3 months) — full rollout
4. **Ongoing Optimization** — continuous improvement

I love that the workshop is free. That's a low barrier to entry. I could literally just book a free workshop to see if they're a good fit before committing any money. That's smart on their part and good for me.

### AI FAQ

The FAQ mentions "What is agentic AI?" and "Do I need to change my tech stack?" — both questions I would actually ask. The fact that they're addressing these shows they're thinking about it at the right level.

But ngl, this whole page is very much framed around enterprise automation — Salesforce Agentforce, staffing firms, B2B use cases. I want to build a consumer AI app, not an enterprise automation workflow. The SKILLS are relevant to me, but the FRAMING isn't quite right.

---

## The Our Work / Portfolio Page

Alright let me check their actual work. This is usually where agencies either impress me or lose me.

Hero: **"Our Work & Case Studies."** Simple. There's a "Filter By" industries dropdown.

### Enterprise Case Studies

The case study list is LONG — like 40+ projects. Let me skim through these:

- **Kawasaki** — "Optimized Workflows with a Self-Service Portal"
- **Bullhorn** — "AI-Enhanced Self-Service Hub Drives Efficiency Gains"
- **MD Anderson** — "Advanced Cancer Research with Curefaster" — okay that's actually really cool, cancer research platform
- **Whirlpool** — "Transformed Its Testing Labs with a Scalable Web App"
- **Financial Services Firm** — "AI Process Automation Enhanced Efficiency for a Leading Consumer Lender"
- **Healthcare Insurance Platform** — "AI Automation to Streamline Claim Reviews"
- **Lurie Children's Hospital** — "Data-Driven Mental Health App Aids Schools" — that's fire, a mental health app for schools
- **Biotech Organization** — "Elevated the Provider Experience to Help 10M+ Patients"
- **Actuarial Firm** — "Projects $2M Profit Increase with AI-Workflows"

### Consumer/Startup Case Studies

- **Harvard** — "Next Gen Web-Based Application for Global Users"
- **Tiny House Listings** — TinyHouseListings.com? That's a CONSUMER marketplace! "Digital App Accelerated Growth." FINALLY a consumer-facing product! That's more my vibe.
- **John Ball Zoo** — "Streamlined the Checkout Experience for Users"
- **Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo** — "Scalable Online Ticket App for 25M+ Users" — 25 MILLION USERS. That's consumer scale!
- **Chicago Line Cruises** — "Mobile-Friendly Ticketing Site"
- **Breadcrumb** — "Receives 10 Million Views with New App Debut" — 10 million views? That's consumer traction.
- **Algofast** — "Event-based Trading for the Average Investor" — fintech consumer app
- **NextLot** — "Scaled to $2B+ with a Custom Auction Platform" — two BILLION? That's insane.
- **Prepmedians** — "Engaging, Test-Ready Digital Tools Fast" — edtech
- **Guild Row** — "Mobile-First Member App"

Okay so I was wrong to assume they only do enterprise. Buried in this massive portfolio there ARE consumer-facing apps — Tiny House Listings, Breadcrumb (10M views), Omaha Zoo (25M users), NextLot ($2B!), Algofast. They do have startup/consumer experience, it's just not what they LEAD with. Their marketing is very enterprise-focused but the actual work is more diverse.

That Breadcrumb project getting 10 million views on debut, and NextLot scaling to $2B+ — those are the case studies I wish were on the homepage instead of the Salesforce and workflow stuff. If I were their marketing person I'd lead with those for founders like me.

## The About Us Page

Hero: **"Our Award-Winning Digital Product Firm."** "Since 2012, we've helped over 240 companies across the globe build digital products that empower growth, leave a lasting impression, and transform their user experience."

Since 2012 — so they've been around for 13+ years. That's actually a long time for a dev agency. They've survived multiple economic cycles. Respect.

### Awards & Ratings

They have Clutch badges: Top Salesforce Company 2023, Top Software Developers United States 2023, Top 1000 Companies Global 2021. Clutch is legit — it's like Yelp for agencies but with verified reviews. 4.8/5 rating on Clutch. That's really good.

### Value Props

Their value props:
- **Deep Experience** — 12+ years, 730+ projects, 4.8/5 Clutch rating
- **Holistic Capability** — web, mobile, CRM, they do it all
- **On the Cutting Edge** — "From AI like ChatGPT to Salesforce products like Agentforce, we're on the cutting edge to bring you into the future." Okay I like that they name-dropped ChatGPT. It shows they're at least aware of the consumer AI space, not just enterprise.

### Leadership Team

The team: Scott Weisman (Co-Founder & CEO), Ryan Francis (Partner, President, & Head of Sales), Brendan Hennessy (Co-Founder & CTO), Monique Silva (VP of Design), Scott Brittain (VP of Client Growth), and more. All linked to LinkedIn. That's transparent, I dig it. The team is sizeable — they've got specialized roles for design, product, engineering, delivery. It's a proper org, not a two-person shop pretending to be an agency.

Having a VP of Design and a Head of Product specifically — that tells me design and product thinking are first-class concerns, not afterthoughts. That's important for a consumer app.

---

## The Contact Page

Hero: **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** Clean. "Complete the form below to tell us about your project. We will get in touch with you as soon as possible."

### Contact Form

The form is simple: First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, How Can We Help You?, CAPTCHA, Submit. Five fields plus the message box. That's not bad — some agencies have like 15 fields asking about your budget range, timeline, project type, etc. This is relatively frictionless.

### Testimonials

There's a testimonials carousel. The one showing is from **Patrick West, Vice President of Apex Leaders**: *"I think everybody here has been really impressed and really happy with where the app is going. We trust that any crazy idea we cook up, you guys can really digest and say how it can be feasible, which is great."*

Okay I love that quote. "Any crazy idea we cook up, you guys can really digest and say how it can be feasible." That's EXACTLY the kind of partner I want. Someone who can take my wild AI app vision and tell me what's actually buildable.

### Contact Details

Below the form there's a "Let's Connect" section with:
- **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com
- **Call:** (312) 888-9651
- **LinkedIn:** Connect link

Three ways to reach out — form, email, phone. Plus LinkedIn. That's good. Multiple channels. I'd probably just email them tbh, or fill out the form.

---

## The Technologies Page

I want to see what tech stack they use because that matters a LOT to me.

Hero: **"Product Development Technologies Driving Digital Transformation."** Okay they said "Digital Transformation" — that's a cringe phrase for me personally, but whatever.

### Salesforce Ecosystem

**Salesforce Products:** Salesforce (CRM), Heroku, Experience Cloud, Agentforce. Yeah, they're DEEP in the Salesforce ecosystem. Like, really deep. That's their bread and butter it seems.

### Platforms & Technologies

**Platforms & Technologies:**
- **Artificial Intelligence** — "Apply AI in practical, targeted ways to streamline operations, improve customer experiences, and unlock new growth."
- **Contentful** — headless CMS. I've used Contentful before, it's decent.

### Frameworks & Languages

**Frameworks & Languages:**
- **Ruby on Rails** — "Known for its simplicity and power, Ruby on Rails helps turn your ideas into scalable, user-friendly applications." Rails! Interesting. A lot of big startups were built on Rails — Shopify, GitHub, Airbnb. Not the flashiest choice in 2026 but battle-tested.
- **ReactJS** — "a fast, flexible JavaScript library, ReactJS is perfect for creating dynamic, high-performance user experiences." React is the standard for frontend. Good.
- **Ionic** — "One of the most efficient open-source frameworks, Ionic helps build dynamic mobile apps fast." Ionic for mobile — that's cross-platform hybrid. Not React Native, not Flutter, but Ionic. Hm. Ionic is fine but I'd personally prefer React Native or Flutter for a consumer app where performance matters.

### Tech Philosophy

Their approach to tech selection: "We don't take a one-size-fits-all approach to technology. Every project starts with a deep understanding of the business, the customer, and the existing tech stack." They say they're "tech-agnostic" — choosing the right tool for the job. I like that philosophy.

They mention aligning with your internal capabilities: "If you have in-house developers or a tech team, we align our stack choices with their expertise. That way, you're empowered to own and extend the product after launch, not dependent on us forever." That's really important. I'm a dev myself. I want to eventually own and maintain whatever they build. The fact that they think about handoff and empowerment is a huge green flag.

---

## Overall Impressions

### What Worked

- They're legit. 13+ years, 730+ projects, 240+ clients, 4.8/5 on Clutch.
- AI is clearly a priority, not an afterthought. Dedicated AI services, agentic AI deployment, internal AI tools.
- Speed to market is emphasized heavily — 6 weeks to launch, 5x faster, 50% less time.
- The free AI Opportunity Workshop is a great low-commitment entry point.
- Their portfolio is WAY more diverse than the homepage suggests.
- The team is structured with dedicated design, product, and engineering leadership.
- They think about handoff and empowerment.
- Contact is easy — form, email, phone, LinkedIn. Multiple options.

### What Didn't Work

- The marketing is VERY enterprise-focused. "Modern Enterprise," "Digital Transformation," "Operational Efficiency," "ROI."
- Salesforce is EVERYWHERE. It feels like 40% of their identity.
- The framing doesn't speak to startup founders at all. No mention of startups, MVPs, product-market fit, or early-stage product development.
- The "Company Email" field on the form is mildly intimidating for someone with a personal email address.
- No pricing transparency whatsoever.
- Tech stack listing feels dated — no mention of Next.js, TypeScript-first, Vercel, Supabase.
- Homepage case studies are all enterprise — consumer wins are buried in the portfolio.
- Grammar issue on Services page: "deliver more better and faster."

### Bottom Line

LaunchPad Lab is clearly a legit, experienced agency with real AI chops. They've worked with massive brands AND they've actually built consumer products at scale — they just don't market that side very well. If I reached out, I'd want to know: (1) do they work with early-stage startups, (2) what's the budget look like for an MVP, and (3) can they work in a modern JS/TS stack, not just Rails.

The contact info is easy to find — **contact@launchpadlab.com** or **(312) 888-9651**, plus the form on literally every page. I might actually fill out that form or shoot them an email. The free AI Opportunity Workshop is the lowest-risk way to engage.
