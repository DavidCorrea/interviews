## Executive Summary

Jayden was able to complete all three goals — he found what the company does, explored their services in depth, and located multiple contact methods. However, the experience was marked by a persistent disconnect between the site's enterprise-focused messaging and Jayden's needs as a startup founder building a consumer product. The site's capabilities are broader than its marketing suggests, which means potential clients like Jayden nearly bounced before discovering relevant portfolio work.

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Enterprise-Centric Messaging Alienates Startup Founders {#issue-1}

**Severity:** High  
**Pages Affected:** Homepage, Services, AI Automation

The site's language is heavily tilted toward enterprise audiences. Phrases like "Modern Enterprise," "Digital Transformation," "Operational Efficiency," and "modernize operations, reduce costs" appear throughout key pages. For a founder looking for an agency to build a consumer AI app, this messaging signals that the company doesn't work with startups or early-stage products.

Jayden's reaction: *"This is already giving enterprise energy, ngl"* ([Homepage Hero](../01%20-%20Interviews/jayden-rivera-interview.md#homepage-hero)). He nearly disengaged on the homepage before deciding to explore further.

**Recommendation:** Add startup/founder-oriented messaging alongside enterprise copy, especially on the homepage. Reference MVPs, product-market fit, and early-stage product development.

---

### Issue 2: Consumer Portfolio Buried Under Enterprise Case Studies {#issue-2}

**Severity:** High  
**Pages Affected:** Homepage, Portfolio

The homepage case study carousel exclusively features enterprise clients (Millennium Trust, Prosci/Salesforce, CDK Global). The site's impressive consumer-facing work — Breadcrumb (10M views), NextLot ($2B+), Omaha Zoo (25M users), Tiny House Listings — is buried deep in the portfolio page and requires extensive scrolling to discover.

Jayden's reaction: *"Those are the case studies I wish were on the homepage instead of the Salesforce and workflow stuff"* ([Portfolio - Consumer Case Studies](../01%20-%20Interviews/jayden-rivera-interview.md#portfolio-consumer)).

**Recommendation:** Feature at least one consumer/startup case study in the homepage carousel. Consider adding a "Startups & Consumer Apps" filter or dedicated section on the portfolio page.

---

### Issue 3: Overemphasis on Salesforce Identity {#issue-3}

**Severity:** Medium  
**Pages Affected:** Homepage, Technologies, AI Automation, About Us, Footer

Salesforce branding permeates the entire site — from the footer badge to dedicated service pages, Agentforce mentions on the AI page, and Clutch badges highlighting Salesforce specifically. For users who don't need Salesforce (which includes most startup founders), this creates the impression that the agency is primarily a Salesforce shop.

Jayden's reaction: *"Salesforce is EVERYWHERE on this site. It feels like 40% of their identity"* ([Overall Impressions](../01%20-%20Interviews/jayden-rivera-interview.md#overall-negative)).

**Recommendation:** Balance Salesforce visibility with other technology capabilities. Ensure non-Salesforce services receive equal visual weight.

---

### Issue 4: "Company Email" Field Creates Barrier for Solo Founders {#issue-4}

**Severity:** Medium  
**Pages Affected:** Contact form (appears on every page)

The contact form labels the email field as "Company Email," which signals that inquiries from individuals using personal email addresses (e.g., gmail.com) are unwelcome. For a solo founder who doesn't yet have a company domain, this is exclusionary.

Jayden's reaction: *"They ask for 'Company Email' not just 'Email' which tells me they're expecting business inquiries, not randos with gmail accounts. That's a little intimidating for a solo founder"* ([Homepage Footer](../01%20-%20Interviews/jayden-rivera-interview.md#homepage-footer)).

**Recommendation:** Change the label to "Email" or "Work Email." Alternatively, make the "Company" field optional and use "Email" generically.

---

### Issue 5: No Pricing Transparency {#issue-5}

**Severity:** Medium  
**Pages Affected:** Entire site

There is zero indication of pricing ranges, engagement tiers, or budget expectations anywhere on the site. For a founder with limited (or no) budget, there's no way to self-qualify before reaching out. This may deter founders who assume the agency is out of their price range.

Jayden's reaction: *"No pricing transparency whatsoever. I have zero idea if they cost $10K or $500K"* ([Overall Impressions](../01%20-%20Interviews/jayden-rivera-interview.md#overall-negative)).

**Recommendation:** Consider adding engagement tier ranges (e.g., "MVPs start at $X") or at minimum, a FAQ entry that sets expectations. The free AI Opportunity Workshop is a good step but isn't a substitute for pricing context.

---

### Issue 6: Technology Stack Listing Feels Dated {#issue-6}

**Severity:** Medium  
**Pages Affected:** Technologies page

The listed technologies — Ruby on Rails, ReactJS, Ionic — are solid but don't reflect the modern startup tech ecosystem. There's no mention of Next.js, TypeScript-first architectures, Vercel, Supabase, or other tools that Gen-Z developers and startup founders gravitate toward. While the agency claims to be "tech-agnostic," the listed stack creates a perception gap.

Jayden's reaction: *"No mention of Next.js, TypeScript-first architectures, Vercel, Supabase, or the indie hacker / startup tech stack that I'm more familiar with"* ([Technologies - Frameworks](../01%20-%20Interviews/jayden-rivera-interview.md#tech-frameworks)).

**Recommendation:** Update the Technologies page to include modern frameworks and platforms. If the agency works with Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase, etc., list them. If truly tech-agnostic, showcase the breadth of options.

---

### Issue 7: Homepage Hero Copy Is Generic {#issue-7}

**Severity:** Low  
**Pages Affected:** Homepage

The headline "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." is perceived as generic. "Results that Matter" in particular is a phrase that could appear on any agency site and adds no differentiation.

Jayden's reaction: *"'Results that Matter' is the kind of thing every single agency says"* ([Homepage Hero](../01%20-%20Interviews/jayden-rivera-interview.md#homepage-hero)).

**Recommendation:** Replace generic taglines with specific, differentiating claims (e.g., referencing the 6-week launch timeline or the 730+ projects track record).

---

### Issue 8: Grammar Error on Services Page {#issue-8}

**Severity:** Low  
**Pages Affected:** Services page

The tagline reads "deliver more better and faster" which is grammatically awkward.

Jayden's reaction: *"the grammar on 'deliver more better and faster' is a little awkward"* ([Services Page](../01%20-%20Interviews/jayden-rivera-interview.md#services)).

**Recommendation:** Revise to "deliver more, better, and faster" or "deliver better results, faster."

---

### Issue 9: CAPTCHA on Contact Form {#issue-9}

**Severity:** Low  
**Pages Affected:** Contact form (all pages)

The contact form includes a CAPTCHA iframe. While necessary for spam prevention, CAPTCHAs add friction to the contact process and can be an accessibility barrier for users with various disabilities.

Noted at: [Homepage Footer](../01%20-%20Interviews/jayden-rivera-interview.md#homepage-footer)

**Recommendation:** Consider using invisible CAPTCHA (reCAPTCHA v3) or honeypot fields to reduce friction while maintaining spam protection.

---

### Issue 10: No Startup/MVP-Specific Content {#issue-10}

**Severity:** Medium  
**Pages Affected:** Entire site

The site has no dedicated content addressing startup founders, MVP development, or early-stage product building. Despite evidence in the portfolio that the agency has done this work, there's no landing page, blog post, or service tier that speaks to this audience.

Jayden's reaction: *"The framing doesn't speak to startup founders at all. No mention of startups, MVPs, product-market fit"* ([Overall Impressions](../01%20-%20Interviews/jayden-rivera-interview.md#overall-negative)).

**Recommendation:** Create a startup-focused landing page or service tier. Reference relevant consumer/startup case studies. Use language that resonates with founders (MVP, product-market fit, seed stage, etc.).

---

## What Worked Well

- **AI positioning is strong.** The site leads with AI across all pages, and the dedicated AI Automation page demonstrates real depth (agentic AI, autonomous automation, rapid rollouts).
- **Speed-to-market messaging resonates.** "6 weeks to launch," "5x faster," "50% less time" — these claims caught Jayden's attention repeatedly.
- **Free AI Opportunity Workshop** is an excellent low-barrier entry point for prospective clients.
- **Contact information is easy to find** — email, phone, form, and LinkedIn are all available.
- **Portfolio depth is impressive** once discovered — 730+ projects across diverse industries and product types.
- **Handoff and empowerment philosophy** (aligning with client's internal capabilities) is a strong trust signal for technical founders.
- **Leadership team transparency** (names, roles, LinkedIn profiles) builds credibility.
