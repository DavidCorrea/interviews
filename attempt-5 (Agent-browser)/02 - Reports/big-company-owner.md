# Accessibility Report: LaunchPad Lab Website
## Persona: Richard Okonkwo — Big Company CEO (Non-Technical)

**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Website:** https://launchpadlab.com/  
**Pages Reviewed:** Homepage, Services, Our Work, Industries, Contact  
**Evaluator Lens:** Non-technical business executive under time pressure seeking custom software

---

## Executive Summary

The LaunchPad Lab website is professionally designed and visually polished, but it presents significant **cognitive accessibility** barriers for non-technical business decision-makers — the very audience most likely to commission high-value custom software projects. The site's heavy reliance on tech industry jargon, AI-first messaging, and abstract marketing language creates friction for users who need clear, concrete answers quickly. While visual design, structural navigation, and contact mechanisms are strong, the content strategy fails to serve a critical user segment: senior business leaders who need custom software but don't speak the language of software development.

## Issues

### Issue 1: AI-First Messaging Obscures Core Value Proposition

**Location:** Homepage — Hero section (H1 heading)  
**Content:** "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."  
**Page:** https://launchpadlab.com/

**Description:** The primary headline leads with "AI Innovation," which is irrelevant to a large percentage of prospective clients who need custom software for operational problems (inventory management, workflow automation, internal tools). The term "Digital Solutions" is vague and does not communicate that the company builds custom software applications.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** A CEO searching for "custom software company" lands on this page and cannot immediately confirm that LaunchPad Lab builds the kind of system they need. The AI-centric framing may make them think the company specializes exclusively in AI products, causing them to leave. First impressions form within 5-10 seconds — this headline fails to answer the question "Can you help me?" for a significant user segment.

**Suggested Fix:** Add a secondary headline or subheading that plainly states the core offering: "We build custom software for businesses — web applications, internal tools, and operational platforms." Keep AI messaging as a secondary value proposition rather than the lead.

**Priority:** **High**

### Issue 2: Pervasive Technical Jargon Without Explanation

**Location:** Multiple pages — Services descriptions, Process section, Industries page  
**Pages:** Homepage, Services (https://launchpadlab.com/services/), Industries (https://launchpadlab.com/industries/)

**Description:** The site uses extensive technical terminology without explanation:
- **"Agile"** — Used in "Agile, cross-functional expertise" (Product Strategy & Design service description)
- **"Sprint"** / **"Sprint releases"** — Used in "Build iteratively with bi-weekly sprint releases" (Process section) and "2 Sprints to Build a Prototype" (Services page)
- **"MVP"** — Referenced in service contexts without definition
- **"UAT"** — "UAT validation ensures nothing goes unchecked" (Process section, QA Testing)
- **"Agentic AI"** — "AI Automation & Agentic AI" (Services)
- **"Cross-functional"** — Used repeatedly across multiple pages
- **"Product discovery"** — Used without explaining what it means in practice
- **"Bespoke"** — "Bespoke, redefining experiences" (Web App Development tagline)
- **"CI/CD"** — Referenced in technology contexts
- **"UX"** / **"UI/UX"** — Used in Industries page problems table and elsewhere
- **"Headless commerce"** — Blog post prominently featured in Related Content sections

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** These terms are the everyday language of software development teams but are completely meaningless to business executives. A CEO reading "Build iteratively with bi-weekly sprint releases" cannot understand the process being described. The term "UAT validation" conveys nothing. This creates a comprehension gap that erodes trust — if the company can't explain their process in plain English on their website, how will communication work during a project?

**Suggested Fix:** Replace jargon with plain-language equivalents throughout:
- "Sprint releases" → "We build in two-week cycles and show you progress regularly"
- "UAT validation" → "You test the software before it goes live"
- "Agile, cross-functional expertise" → "Our teams include designers, developers, and strategists who work together and adapt quickly"
- "Agentic AI" → "AI tools that work autonomously on your behalf"
- "Bespoke" → "Custom-built for your business"

Alternatively, add brief parenthetical definitions or tooltips for technical terms.

**Priority:** **High**

### Issue 3: "Digital Product" Terminology Is Confusing for Target Audience

**Location:** Sitewide — appears in hero sections, headings, and body copy across all pages  
**Pages:** All pages reviewed

**Description:** The term "digital product" is used as the primary descriptor for what LaunchPad Lab builds. It appears in nearly every heading and section: "AI-Centered Digital Product Development," "Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast," "Build Digital Products that Deliver Outcomes," etc.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** A CEO looking for custom software does not think of their needed inventory management system as a "digital product." They think of it as "software," "a system," "an application," or "a tool." The term "digital product" is industry parlance that creates cognitive distance. The user has to mentally translate "digital product" into "software" every time they encounter it, adding friction to comprehension.

**Suggested Fix:** Use "software," "application," "system," or "platform" interchangeably with "digital product" — especially in headlines and hero sections where first impressions are formed. Consider A/B testing headlines like "We Build Custom Software for Businesses" vs. the current AI/digital product framing.

**Priority:** **High**

---

### Issue 4: No Industry Coverage for Food/Distribution/Logistics/Manufacturing

**Location:** Industries page  
**Page:** https://launchpadlab.com/industries/

**Description:** The Industries page lists nine industries: Financial Services, Private Equity, Healthcare, Professional Services, Insurance, Technology, Legal, Knowledge/Education, Social Impact. There is no mention of food and beverage, distribution, logistics, supply chain, or manufacturing — despite these being large sectors with significant custom software needs and despite the case studies page showing work for companies like Kawasaki (manufacturing/engines) and American Truck Business Services (logistics).

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** A CEO of a food distribution company visiting this page will not see their industry represented, leading them to conclude that LaunchPad Lab doesn't have relevant experience. This is a direct credibility gap. The "industry-agnostic" claim in the body copy contradicts the narrow industry list, creating confusion. This may cause high-value leads to self-select out.

**Suggested Fix:** Either expand the Industries list to include Manufacturing, Logistics/Distribution, and Supply Chain (supported by existing case studies like Kawasaki, American Truck Business Services), or restructure the page to lead with the "industry-agnostic" message and organize by *problem type* rather than industry vertical. Adding a line like "Don't see your industry? We've built solutions across 50+ industries" with a CTA would also help.

**Priority:** **High**

---

### Issue 5: No "What Happens Next" Information After Contact Form Submission

**Location:** Contact page, and all embedded contact forms across the site  
**Pages:** https://launchpadlab.com/contact/, Homepage, Services, Our Work, Industries (all have embedded forms)

**Description:** The contact form says "Complete the form below to tell us about your project. We will get in touch with you as soon as possible." There is no information about:
- How soon someone will respond (same day? 24 hours? 48 hours?)
- What the response will look like (phone call? email?)
- What the first meeting/conversation will cover
- What the prospect should prepare

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** A CEO under time pressure needs certainty. "As soon as possible" is vague and does not convey urgency or responsiveness. Without knowing what the next step looks like, the user may hesitate to submit the form — or may submit it and immediately feel anxious about whether it was received. Competitors who promise "We'll call you within 24 hours" or "Book a 30-minute call" will win this prospect's attention.

**Suggested Fix:** Add a clear post-submission expectation block:
- "After you submit, here's what happens: **Step 1:** We review your message within 4 business hours. **Step 2:** A team member calls or emails you to schedule a free 30-minute discovery call. **Step 3:** We discuss your challenges and explore how we can help."
- Consider adding a Calendly or scheduling link for immediate booking.

**Priority:** **High**

### Issue 6: No Pricing Guidance Anywhere on the Site

**Location:** Sitewide — absent from all pages  
**Pages:** All pages reviewed

**Description:** There is no pricing information, cost ranges, typical project budgets, or even a mention of budget expectations anywhere on the website. Not in Services, not in FAQ, not on the Contact page.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** A CEO comparing 5 companies needs to understand if LaunchPad Lab is in their budget range before reaching out. Without any pricing context, the prospect has no way to self-qualify. This creates two problems: (1) sticker shock during the first call, wasting both parties' time, and (2) prospects who assume the company is either too expensive or too cheap, and never reach out to find out.

**Suggested Fix:** Add a FAQ entry or a dedicated section addressing pricing honestly: "Custom software projects typically range from $X to $Y, depending on complexity, timeline, and scope. We work with you during discovery to define a budget and scope that aligns with your goals." Even directional guidance helps.

**Priority:** **Medium**

---

### Issue 7: Marketing Fluff in Service Descriptions Provides No Concrete Information

**Location:** Homepage services cards, Services page  
**Pages:** https://launchpadlab.com/, https://launchpadlab.com/services/

**Description:** Several service descriptions use vague, aspirational language that conveys no concrete information:
- Web Application Development: **"Bespoke, redefining experiences"**
- Mobile Application Development: **"Meeting users where they are"**
- Product Strategy & Design: **"Agile, cross-functional expertise"**
- AI Automation & Agentic AI: **"Enabling an autonomous digital workforce"**

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** These taglines are meaningless to someone trying to determine if the company can build them an inventory management system. "Redefining experiences" does not tell a CEO what a web application is or what it does for their business. "Meeting users where they are" is a marketing platitude, not a value proposition. A pressured executive scanning these descriptions will learn nothing about what these services actually deliver.

**Suggested Fix:** Replace taglines with concrete benefit statements:
- "Bespoke, redefining experiences" → "Custom web-based software for your business operations"
- "Meeting users where they are" → "Mobile apps for your team and customers"
- "Agile, cross-functional expertise" → "Strategic planning to define what to build and why"
- "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce" → "Automate repetitive tasks and workflows with AI"

**Priority:** **Medium**

---

### Issue 8: Hero Section Heading Has Low Contrast / Readability Issues

**Location:** Homepage hero section  
**Page:** https://launchpadlab.com/

**Description:** The hero section displays white text over a dark photograph of people in a meeting room. The heading "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." and the body paragraph are rendered in white text on a semi-transparent dark overlay on a photograph. The background image has areas of varying brightness (lighter areas around the right side with the "Explore all Services" overlay), which can reduce contrast and legibility for some users.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** Users with any degree of visual impairment, or users in bright environments (e.g., reading on a laptop near a window), may struggle to read the hero text. The background image also creates visual noise that competes with the text content.

**Suggested Fix:** Increase the opacity of the dark overlay to ensure consistent WCAG AA contrast ratio (minimum 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text) across the entire hero image. Alternatively, use a solid color block behind the text area.

**Priority:** **Medium**

---

### Issue 9: Case Study Carousel on Homepage Limits Content Discoverability

**Location:** Homepage — "Our Latest Case Studies" section  
**Page:** https://launchpadlab.com/

**Description:** The case studies are presented in a carousel/slider with pagination buttons (three pages). Only 3 case studies are visible at a time. Users must click small dot buttons to navigate between carousel pages.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** Carousels are frequently ignored or missed by users, especially those scanning quickly. A CEO in a hurry will see 3 case studies and may not realize there are more. The small pagination dots are easy to overlook. If the visible case studies aren't relevant to the user's industry, they may conclude that LaunchPad Lab doesn't have relevant experience — even if a relevant case study exists on another carousel page. Auto-rotating carousels also present accessibility challenges for screen reader users and users with motor impairments.

**Suggested Fix:** Replace the carousel with a static grid showing 6-9 case studies, or use a "View all case studies" link prominently. If keeping the carousel, add clear "Next/Previous" arrow buttons and visible text like "Showing 1-3 of 9 case studies."

**Priority:** **Medium**

### Issue 10: reCAPTCHA Creates Friction in Contact Form

**Location:** Contact page — contact form  
**Page:** https://launchpadlab.com/contact/

**Description:** The contact form includes a reCAPTCHA "I'm not a robot" checkbox that users must complete before submitting. While this is standard spam prevention, it adds an extra step to the contact flow.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** While most users can complete a reCAPTCHA, it adds friction at the critical moment of conversion. For users with cognitive disabilities, motor impairments, or those on mobile devices, image-based CAPTCHAs (if triggered) can be frustrating or inaccessible. For a pressured CEO, any additional step between "I want to contact them" and "Done" is a potential drop-off point.

**Suggested Fix:** Consider using invisible reCAPTCHA (v3) which works in the background without user interaction, or use honeypot fields as a less intrusive alternative to visible CAPTCHAs.

**Priority:** **Low**

---

### Issue 11: Duplicate Contact Forms Create Decision Fatigue

**Location:** All pages — embedded contact forms at the bottom of every page  
**Pages:** Homepage, Services, Our Work, Industries, Contact

**Description:** Every page on the site includes a full contact form at the bottom ("Let's Build Something Great" / "Ready to Build Something Great?"). The Contact page itself starts with a form and also has an additional embedded form further down the page. This means some pages have the same form appearing twice.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** While having contact forms readily available is good for conversion, the duplication on the Contact page itself is confusing. Users who scroll down the Contact page encounter a second identical form and may wonder if they missed something, or if the forms go to different places. This creates mild cognitive friction.

**Suggested Fix:** On the Contact page, remove the duplicate embedded form at the bottom. On other pages, the embedded form is appropriate. Consider differentiating the footer CTA ("Ready to talk? Call us at (312) 888-9651 or fill out the form above") rather than repeating the full form.

**Priority:** **Low**

### Issue 12: Navigation Label "Technologies" Is Confusing for Non-Technical Users

**Location:** Main navigation bar — all pages  
**Pages:** Sitewide

**Description:** The main navigation includes a "Technologies" link. For a non-technical user, "Technologies" is ambiguous — it could mean the technologies the company uses to build software (React, Python, etc.), or it could mean the types of technology solutions they provide.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** A CEO does not care what programming languages the company uses. The "Technologies" page is not relevant to their decision-making process, but its presence in the navigation takes up space and cognitive bandwidth. It also may create the impression that the site is aimed at technical audiences, not business leaders.

**Suggested Fix:** Consider renaming to "How We Build" or "Our Tools & Platforms" if the goal is to showcase technical capabilities, or deprioritizing it from the main navigation into a footer link. Business decision-makers care about outcomes, not technology stacks.

**Priority:** **Low**

### Issue 13: "Discovery Space Navigator" Uses Unclear Naming and Jargon

**Location:** Services page — mid-page CTA section  
**Page:** https://launchpadlab.com/services/

**Description:** There is a section called "Discovery Space Navigator" described as a "3-Step Blueprint for What to Build." It references "Mission Control — our proprietary AI tool" and uses terms like "Sprints" without definition. The name "Discovery Space Navigator" is abstract and doesn't communicate its purpose clearly.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** A CEO reading this section would be confused by the space/mission metaphor. "Discovery Space Navigator" sounds like a NASA tool, not a business consulting process. The value proposition — "tell us about your problem and we'll tell you what to build" — is actually excellent and highly relevant, but the naming and jargon obscure it. The concrete data points ("2 Sprints to Build a Prototype, 6 Weeks or Less to Launch, 5x Faster Time to Market") are compelling but "Sprints" is undefined.

**Suggested Fix:** Rename to something plain like "Get Your Custom Roadmap" or "Your Free Project Blueprint." Replace "Sprints" with "two-week cycles" or just say "4 weeks to build a prototype." Lead with the value: "Tell us your business challenge. We'll create a custom plan showing exactly what to build, in 3 simple steps."

**Priority:** **Medium**

### Issue 14: FAQ Sections Are Collapsed and May Be Missed

**Location:** Services page, Industries page — FAQ sections at the bottom  
**Pages:** https://launchpadlab.com/services/, https://launchpadlab.com/industries/

**Description:** Both the Services and Industries pages include FAQ sections with highly relevant questions ("How much does it cost to build a custom software solution?", "How long does it take to build a digital product?", "How fast will we see results?"). However, all answers are collapsed by default and require clicking to expand.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** A CEO scanning the page may see the FAQ section heading and the list of questions, but may not click to expand them. Collapsed content is frequently skipped by users who are scanning quickly. These FAQs contain some of the most valuable information on the site for a business decision-maker, but their collapsed state makes them easy to overlook.

**Suggested Fix:** Consider having the first 2-3 most important FAQs expanded by default, especially "How much does it cost?" and "How long does it take?" These are the #1 and #2 questions business owners have. Alternatively, surface the answers to these key questions in a dedicated "What to Expect" section higher on the page.

**Priority:** **Medium**

---

### Issue 15: No Visible Search Functionality

**Location:** Sitewide  
**Pages:** All pages reviewed

**Description:** There is no search bar or search functionality visible on any page of the website. A user looking for specific content (e.g., "inventory," "logistics," "supply chain") has no way to search the site.

**Impact on non-technical business owners:** A CEO who lands on the homepage and doesn't immediately find content relevant to their industry or problem has no way to search for it. They must manually browse through pages hoping to find what they need. Given that this user has 5 tabs open and limited patience, the inability to search is a significant friction point.

**Suggested Fix:** Add a search feature (even a simple one) accessible from the navigation bar or header. This allows users to quickly find case studies, blog posts, or service descriptions relevant to their specific needs.

**Priority:** **Low**

## Key Recommendations

1. **Lead with clarity, not trends.** The homepage hero should plainly state that LaunchPad Lab builds custom software for businesses. AI can be a secondary message, not the primary one.

2. **Eliminate or define all jargon.** Every instance of "Agile," "Sprint," "UAT," "MVP," "cross-functional," "bespoke," and similar terms should be replaced with plain-English equivalents or briefly explained.

3. **Expand industry representation.** Add manufacturing, logistics/distribution, and supply chain to the Industries page, supported by existing case studies (Kawasaki, American Truck Business Services).

4. **Set explicit expectations for the contact process.** Tell users exactly what happens after they submit the form — response time, format, and what the first conversation will cover.

5. **Provide directional pricing guidance.** Even a broad range helps business owners self-qualify and builds trust through transparency.

6. **Replace marketing taglines with benefit statements.** Service descriptions should tell a non-technical reader exactly what the service delivers in concrete terms.

7. **Surface key FAQ answers.** The most important questions (cost, timeline, process) should be answered prominently, not hidden in collapsed accordion sections.
