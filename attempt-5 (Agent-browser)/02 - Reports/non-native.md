# Accessibility Report: Non-Native English Speaker (Yuki Tanaka)

**Persona:** Yuki Tanaka — Intermediate English speaker (B1-B2 CEFR), Japanese native  
**Website:** https://launchpadlab.com/  
**Date:** February 18, 2026

## Executive Summary

The LaunchPad Lab website presents significant language accessibility barriers for non-native English speakers at the intermediate level. The site relies heavily on English idioms, unexplained industry jargon, marketing superlatives, and complex sentence structures that increase cognitive load and reduce comprehension. While structural elements (navigation labels, contact forms, visual elements) are generally accessible, the text content would benefit substantially from plain language practices. An estimated 40-50% of the homepage copy contains language that would cause confusion or require re-reading for a B1-B2 English speaker.

## Issues

### Issue 1: Pervasive Use of English Idioms and Metaphors

**Location:** All pages — hero sections, headings, body copy  
**Examples:**
- "Harness the power of AI" (Homepage hero)
- "Cutting-edge AI consulting" (Homepage, About)
- "Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast" (Homepage)
- "Forging a partnership" (Homepage)
- "Unleash Your Digital Potential" (About Us)
- "Meeting users where they are" (Homepage services)
- "The companies pulling ahead" (Homepage)
- "Leave a lasting impression" (About Us)
- "On the Cutting Edge" (About Us)
- "Operating as an extension of your team" (Homepage services)

**Impact:** High. Idioms are among the hardest language elements for non-native speakers. Each idiom requires the reader to stop, recall or guess the figurative meaning, and mentally translate. When multiple idioms appear in a single paragraph, comprehension drops significantly. A B1-B2 speaker may misinterpret or skip sentences entirely.

**Suggested Fix:** Replace idioms with plain, literal language. For example:
- "Harness the power of AI" → "Use AI effectively"
- "Cutting-edge" → "Advanced" or "Latest"
- "Ship products" → "Deliver products" or "Launch products"
- "Game-changing" → "Important" or "Significant"
- "Forging a partnership" → "Building a partnership"
- "Unleash your potential" → "Reach your goals" or "Grow your capabilities"

**Priority:** High

### Issue 2: Unexplained Acronyms and Industry Jargon

**Location:** Homepage (services section, tabs, approach section), Industries page  
**Examples:**
- **ROI** — used multiple times without ever being defined (Homepage: "go beyond just ROI," "delivers ROI")
- **CSAT** — used in tab section ("boosts CSAT") with no expansion
- **UAT** — used in approach section ("UAT validation") without explanation
- **UI/UX** — used in tab section ("engaging UI/UX") without explanation
- **CRM** — used on About page without definition
- **MVP** — industry term not explained if used
- **Agile** — used as a methodology term ("Agile Approach," "Agile, cross-functional expertise") but never distinguished from the common English word meaning "nimble"
- **Cross-functional** — used 5+ times across the site without ever being defined
- **Bespoke** — used 3+ times; this is an uncommon English word even for native speakers outside the UK
- **Agentic AI** — used in services section; a very new and specialized term

**Impact:** High. Unexplained acronyms and jargon create immediate comprehension barriers. A non-native speaker encountering "boosts CSAT" has no way to understand this without external research. The cumulative effect of multiple undefined terms in a single paragraph makes entire sections unintelligible.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Expand all acronyms on first use: "Return on Investment (ROI)," "Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)," "User Acceptance Testing (UAT)"
- Add a glossary page or tooltip definitions for technical terms
- Replace "bespoke" with "custom" or "custom-built"
- Add brief explanatory text for "Agile" (e.g., "Agile — an iterative approach to software development")
- Define "cross-functional" on first use (e.g., "cross-functional — combining designers, developers, and strategists")

**Priority:** High

---

### Issue 3: Marketing Superlatives That Lack Substance

**Location:** All pages — especially headings and hero sections  
**Examples:**
- "High-impact digital products" (Homepage)
- "Transformative, bottom-line impact" (Homepage)
- "World-class mobile experience" (Industries)
- "Award-winning digital product firm" (About Us — no specific awards named)
- "Mission-critical software" (About Us)
- "One-of-a-kind digital solution" (Industries)
- "Best-in-class" (various)

**Impact:** Medium. Marketing superlatives do not translate well and provide no concrete information. A non-native speaker expends cognitive effort parsing these phrases only to gain no new understanding. Culturally, Japanese business communication tends to favor specific, factual claims over superlatives, so these phrases may also undermine credibility.

**Suggested Fix:** Replace superlatives with specific, verifiable claims. For example:
- "Award-winning" → name the specific awards
- "High-impact" → "Products that have generated $1M+ in revenue for clients"
- "World-class" → remove or replace with specific quality metrics
- "Transformative" → describe the specific transformation

**Priority:** Medium

### Issue 4: Complex Sentence Structures

**Location:** Homepage (hero paragraph, AI partner section), About Us, Industries  
**Examples:**
- *"At LaunchPad Lab, we combine deep expertise in product design and development with cutting-edge AI consulting to solve critical business challenges. We've helped hundreds of businesses across all industries solve complex problems that go beyond just ROI."* (Homepage — 2 sentences, 43 words, multiple nested phrases)
- *"By forging a partnership rather than a mere service agreement, we collaborate on the unique challenges and opportunities your business faces. This allows us to build digital products that are not only bespoke but also deeply aligned with your strategic goals."* (Homepage — complex conditional structure)
- *"Too many teams waste time building something that doesn't add value. Discovery Space Navigator changes that in three simple steps. Just fill out a short form, and we'll run your inputs through Mission Control—our proprietary AI tool built to pinpoint the highest-impact opportunities."* (Industries — dense with embedded clauses)

**Impact:** Medium. Non-native speakers at B1-B2 level process simple Subject-Verb-Object sentences most efficiently. Nested clauses, passive constructions, and long compound sentences require multiple readings and increase the risk of misunderstanding.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Break long sentences into shorter ones (target: 15-20 words per sentence)
- Use active voice consistently
- Follow Subject-Verb-Object order
- One idea per sentence
- Example rewrite: "We design and build software products. We also provide AI consulting. Since 2012, we have completed over 730 projects for 240+ companies."

**Priority:** Medium

### Issue 5: Navigation Label "Insights" Is Ambiguous

**Location:** Main navigation bar (all pages)  
**Description:** The navigation uses "Insights" to label what is essentially a blog or articles section. "Insights" is an abstract, marketing-oriented label that a non-native speaker may not immediately associate with blog posts or articles.

**Impact:** Medium. A non-native speaker looking for articles, news, or educational content may not think to click "Insights." The word "insight" requires intermediate vocabulary and its use as a navigation label is unconventional compared to the more universally understood "Blog," "Articles," or "News."

**Suggested Fix:** Rename to "Blog" or "Articles" — or use a dual label: "Blog & Insights."

**Priority:** Medium

---

### Issue 6: Creative/Metaphorical Product Names Add Cognitive Load

**Location:** Industries page  
**Description:** The "Discovery Space Navigator" feature and "Mission Control" AI tool use space-themed metaphors that extend the LaunchPad brand name. While creative for native English speakers, these names are confusing for non-native speakers who must first parse the metaphor and then understand the actual function.

**Impact:** Medium. "Discovery Space Navigator" sounds like a space exploration tool, not a business process. "Mission Control" evokes NASA, not an AI analysis tool. A non-native speaker must read the full description to understand these are business tools, whereas plain names would communicate instantly.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Consider adding plain-language subtitles: "Discovery Space Navigator — Our process for identifying your best product opportunities"
- For "Mission Control": "Mission Control — Our AI analysis tool"
- Or rename to more descriptive terms: "Product Opportunity Finder," "AI Analysis Platform"

**Priority:** Low

### Issue 7: Informal/Casual Tone May Seem Unprofessional

**Location:** Homepage (contact CTA), footer, various headings  
**Examples:**
- "Let's Build Something Great." (Contact section heading)
- "Let's Get Social" (Footer social media heading)
- "Connect with an Expert" (CTA button)
- "Get in touch with one of our experts today!" (Contact section)

**Impact:** Low. In Japanese business culture, corporate communications tend to be more formal. Casual phrases like "Let's Build Something Great" and "Let's Get Social" may feel overly informal and could be perceived as less serious or professional. While this is primarily a cultural mismatch rather than a comprehension issue, it affects the overall impression and confidence level of the non-native speaker.

**Suggested Fix:** Consider offering more formal alternatives in key CTAs, or at minimum ensure that the casual tone is balanced with substantive, professional content nearby. The contact form labels themselves ("First Name," "Company Email," etc.) are appropriately professional.

**Priority:** Low

---

### Issue 8: Lack of Visual Explanations for Services

**Location:** Homepage services section, Industries page services  
**Description:** Service descriptions rely almost entirely on text. There are no diagrams, flowcharts, icons with labels, or visual representations of what each service entails. The "Our Signature Approach" section (Discover → Deliver → Release) is presented as text-only with no visual process flow.

**Impact:** Medium. Non-native speakers process visual information faster than text in a foreign language. Icons, diagrams, and flowcharts can communicate complex concepts (like the development process, or what "AI Automation" means in practice) without requiring English reading comprehension. The absence of these aids forces the reader to rely entirely on text — the very channel that creates the most friction for them.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Add icons or illustrations to each service card
- Create a visual process diagram for the Discover → Deliver → Release workflow
- Use before/after diagrams or simple infographics to explain AI automation, web development, etc.
- Add screenshots or mockups showing example deliverables for each service

**Priority:** Medium

### Issue 9: Contact Page Lacks Dedicated Content

**Location:** /contact/ URL  
**Description:** Clicking "Contact" in the navigation appears to load the same homepage content rather than a dedicated contact page. The contact form exists in the footer of every page, but there is no standalone contact page with dedicated information about how to reach out, what to expect when contacting, or what information to prepare.

**Impact:** Medium. A non-native speaker who clicks "Contact" expecting a simple, focused page with contact details, a form, and guidance about next steps instead encounters the full homepage. This is disorienting and may cause the user to scroll extensively looking for the contact section. Additionally, the "How Can We Help You?" form field provides no guidance on what to write, which adds uncertainty for someone composing in a foreign language.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Create a dedicated contact page with:
  - Contact form (already exists)
  - Clear explanation of what happens after form submission
  - Phone number and address (already in footer)
  - Expected response time
  - Guidance for the "How Can We Help You?" field (e.g., "Tell us briefly about your project or question")
- Alternatively, ensure the Contact nav link scrolls directly to the contact form section

**Priority:** Medium

### Issue 10: Repetitive Content Across Pages

**Location:** Homepage, Services page (/services/), Contact page (/contact/)  
**Description:** The Services page and Contact page appear to display the same content as the homepage. This creates confusion when navigating — the user clicks a different navigation link but sees the same page, leading to uncertainty about whether they are on the correct page.

**Impact:** Low-Medium. For a non-native speaker who is already investing extra cognitive effort to read English content, encountering the same content on multiple "different" pages is disorienting. It undermines confidence in the site's navigation and makes the user question whether they are finding all available information.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Ensure each navigation link leads to distinct content
- If Services and Contact share homepage content, consider removing them from navigation or differentiating the pages
- Add clear page titles or breadcrumbs so users know which page they are on

**Priority:** Low

---

### Issue 11: No Language Toggle or Multilingual Support

**Location:** Site-wide  
**Description:** The website offers no language selection option, no multilingual content, and no indication that the company can communicate in languages other than English. For an international company that lists clients from various countries and mentions "30+ countries using the tools" (Prosci case study), the absence of any multilingual support is notable.

**Impact:** Low-Medium. While it is not expected that every US-based company offers multilingual websites, for a company that serves international clients and prominently features global metrics, even a basic acknowledgment of international visitors (such as a Google Translate widget, or key information available in other languages) would improve accessibility.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Consider adding a Google Translate widget for key pages
- At minimum, ensure the English text follows plain language guidelines so it translates well with automated tools
- Consider adding a brief multilingual welcome or noting that the team can accommodate international clients

**Priority:** Low
