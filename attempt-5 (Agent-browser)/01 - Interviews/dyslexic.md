## First-Person Narrative

### Landing on the Homepage

I open up launchpadlab.com and the first thing I see is a big hero section with a background photo of a team working together at a table. The headline reads **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."** — it's in a large, bold, white serif-style font. The size is good — I can read it clearly. The words are short and punchy, broken across three lines, which really helps me process each phrase individually instead of getting overwhelmed. I appreciate that.

Below the headline, there's a paragraph:

> "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."

I start reading this slowly. "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness..." — okay, I can follow this. But by the time I get to "tailored consulting and product development services," the words are starting to swim a little. "Tailored" and "consulting" are both long words, and the sentence doesn't break at all. It's one continuous paragraph with no bullet points or bolding to help my eyes find anchors. I have to re-read "modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth" twice to make sure I parsed it correctly — for a moment, "modernize" looked like "monetize" to me, which changed the meaning. The text is white on a dark photo background, and while the contrast is decent, the font size for this paragraph is noticeably smaller than the headline — maybe 16px or so. I'd prefer it bigger.

There's a blue button that says **"Connect with an Expert"** — this is clear and easy to read. Good call-to-action. I note that this likely links to a contact page or form, which is one of my goals.

### Client Logos

Scrolling down, I see a row of client logos: Kawasaki Engines, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, Harvard University, Prosci, Whirlpool, Northwestern University, CDK Global, and more. This is great — logos are visual, I don't have to read anything. Instantly, the presence of names like Harvard and Whirlpool tells me this company is legitimate and works with major brands. This is exactly the kind of visual communication that works for me.

### "AI-Powered Digital Solutions" Section

Next section has a heading: **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."** I can read this, but "Enterprise" takes me a second — my brain initially sees "Enterp-rise" and then corrects itself. Below it is another dense paragraph:

> "At LaunchPad Lab, we combine deep expertise in product design and development with cutting-edge AI consulting to solve critical business challenges. We've helped hundreds of businesses across all industries solve complex problems that go beyond just ROI."

This is a lot of text. The sentences are long and complex. "Cross-functional teams partner with you to deliver results" — I had to re-read this because "cross-functional" is jargon that doesn't immediately make sense to me. What does "cross-functional" mean exactly? I get the gist — different kinds of experts working together — but the word itself is hard to parse. Also, "cutting-edge" briefly looked like "cutting-edge" (correct) but I had to slow down to confirm. I'm starting to feel a little fatigued already and I've only been on the homepage for a couple of minutes.

### Service Cards Section

Scrolling further, I find the services listed as cards: **AI Automation & Agentic AI, Web Application Development, Mobile Application Development, Salesforce Development, Product Strategy & Design, Managed Services & Support.** These are presented as individual cards with headings, short descriptions, and "Learn More" links. The structure is excellent — each service has its own distinct block with a heading in bold. This is much easier to scan than a paragraph. The short descriptor under each heading ("Enabling an autonomous digital workforce," "Bespoke, redefining experiences") gives me just enough context without overwhelming me.

However, I notice some of the words are tricky. **"Agentic AI"** — what is "Agentic"? I've never seen this word before and it looks similar to "Agentive" or "Genetic" at first glance. I have to stare at it for a second. And **"Bespoke"** — I know this word, but it's not plain language. "Custom" would be easier for me.

### Tab Interface — "Problems We Solve"

There's a tabbed section titled **"Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast."** The tabs are: Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement, Scalable Solutions, Expansive Resources, Speed to Market. This visual structure is helpful — I can click on different tabs rather than reading a wall of text. The headings are bold and large. But the words themselves are all multi-syllable business jargon. "Operational Efficiency" — I had to read it twice. "Expansive Resources" briefly looked like "Expensive Resources" to me, which would be a very different message. These word-confusion moments happen regularly for me and they slow me down significantly.

### Stats Section

I love the stats section: **12+ Years in Business, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients.** Big bold numbers with short labels. This is perfect for me. I can absorb this information instantly without reading sentences. Numbers are my friend — they don't jumble or swap like letters do.

### Process Section — Discover, Deliver, Release

The process is broken into three stages: **Discover, Deliver, Release.** Each has sub-steps with short descriptions. This visual structure is good — the three-column layout with headers helps me understand the flow without reading paragraphs. The descriptions under each step are short (one or two sentences), which I appreciate.

### Reading Fatigue Setting In

By the time I reach the middle of the homepage, I'm feeling reading fatigue. There's been a lot of content — paragraphs, headings, cards, tabs, more paragraphs. The page is very long. I've been reading carefully for about 4-5 minutes now and my eyes are tired. The letters are starting to move a bit more than they were at the beginning. I want to find the contact information and move on.

### Contact Form on Homepage

I scroll down further and find a section with a dark blue gradient background that says **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** with a subtitle "Complete the form below to tell us about your project." Below it is a contact form with fields: First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, and "How Can We Help You?" The form labels are clear, bold, and well-spaced. The fields are large. This is quite accessible. The white text on dark blue background has good contrast. I could fill this out if I wanted to. This meets my goal of finding how to contact them.

### Footer

The footer has the company address (2045 W Grand Ave, Chicago, Illinois), a phone number (312-888-9651), and social media links to Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. The footer text is smaller than I'd prefer, and it's light text on a dark background. The phone number is clickable, which is helpful.

### Navigating to the Services Page

I click on "Services" in the navigation. The hero says **"AI-Centered Digital Product Development"** — clear enough, though "AI-Centered" briefly looked like "AI-Censored" to me. The paragraph below it is another dense block: "Our cross-functional teams have the skills and experience to support the full digital product lifecycle, using proven methods to deliver more better and faster with AI at the core." This sentence has a grammatical issue ("deliver more better") that actually confused me more than it should have — I re-read it three times wondering if I was misreading it.

The services are listed again with longer descriptions this time. Each one has a heading, a paragraph, and a "Learn More" link. The paragraph-level descriptions are 2-3 sentences each. They're manageable individually, but seeing six of them stacked vertically is a lot. I read the first three carefully, then my energy drops and I start skimming the last three. I notice that the descriptions use words like "bespoke," "cross-functional," "empower," and "streamline" — all business jargon. They're not hard words individually, but together they create a fog of corporate language that's exhausting to parse.

There's a **"Discovery Space Navigator"** section with a dense paragraph about filling out a form and getting a roadmap. The paragraph is quite long and I struggle to get through it. But the stats next to it (2 Sprints, 6 Weeks, 5x Faster) are great — clear, quick information.

Further down, there's an expandable accordion section labeled **Business, IT, Users** with bullet points inside. The bullet points are helpful — each one is a single sentence, easy to read one at a time. The icons next to each accordion header (Business, IT, Users) help me distinguish between them visually.

The case studies section shows client logos with short heading descriptions. I can quickly scan which companies they've worked with without reading paragraphs. This works well for me.

### Navigating to the About Page

I click "About Us." The hero says **"Our Award-Winning Digital Product Firm"** — clear and easy to read. The sub-heading mentions they've helped 240+ companies since 2012. Good, simple information.

Below the hero is another paragraph describing the company. It's dense again: "LaunchPad Lab is a digital product firm that builds high-impact digital products that drive business results. We work closely with our clients to first understand their unique business challenges and opportunities, then design, develop, and deliver bespoke solutions." This is a long sentence with multiple clauses. "Design, develop, and deliver" — three similar-sounding words starting with 'd' are hard for me. For a moment I confused "develop" and "deliver" and read it as "design, deliver, and deliver." I have to slow down and point at each word mentally.

The Clutch badges are visual and helpful — I can see they're award-winning without reading explanations.

The **"Trusted by Hundreds of Businesses"** section has three cards: Deep Experience, Holistic Capability, On the Cutting Edge. Each has a heading and a short paragraph. This structure is good. But "Holistic Capability" is not plain language — I don't know what "holistic" means in this context without reading the description.

The **leadership team** section shows photos of 15 team members with names and titles. The photos are great — they humanize the company. The titles are short and readable (CEO, CTO, VP of Design, etc.).

There's a video section which I appreciate — video would be much easier for me to consume than text. I wish there were more videos throughout the site.

### Navigating to the Contact Page

I click "Contact" in the navigation, expecting a dedicated contact page. Instead, I land on what appears to be the About Us page again. This is confusing — I expected to see a simple contact page with a form and phone number, not to be redirected to the full About page. I have to scroll all the way down past the leadership team, case studies, and other content to find the contact form at the bottom. This is frustrating. If I'm looking to contact them, I don't want to scroll through an entire page of content to find the form.

## Summary

### Did I achieve my goals?

1. **Figure out what LaunchPad Lab does:** Yes, eventually. They're a Chicago-based digital product firm that builds web apps, mobile apps, and AI solutions for businesses. They've been around since 2012 and work with big names. But it took me more effort than it should have to piece this together because the information is spread across dense paragraphs full of jargon.

2. **Find how to contact them:** Yes. The contact form appears at the bottom of almost every page, and the footer has a phone number and address. However, the dedicated "Contact" link in the navigation doesn't lead to a clean contact page — it goes to the About page, which is confusing.

### What worked well?

- Large, bold headlines that break information into short phrases
- Client logos — instantly communicative without reading
- Stats sections with big numbers (12+ years, 730+ projects, 240+ clients)
- Service cards with individual headings and short descriptions
- Contact form with clear labels and good field sizes
- Leadership team photos humanize the company
- Tab interfaces that let me choose what to read
- Bullet points in accordion sections

### What didn't work?

- Dense paragraphs with complex, multi-clause sentences
- Business jargon ("bespoke," "cross-functional," "holistic capability," "agentic")
- Similar-looking words causing confusion ("modernize" vs "monetize," "expansive" vs "expensive," "develop" vs "deliver")
- Small body text (could be larger for readability)
- No dedicated contact page — "Contact" link goes to the About page
- Very long pages requiring extensive scrolling
- Lack of visual breaks (icons, illustrations) in some text-heavy sections
- No option to adjust text size or spacing on the site itself

### What would help someone like me?

- Shorter paragraphs (2-3 sentences maximum)
- Plain language instead of jargon
- Larger body text (18px minimum)
- More generous line-height and letter-spacing
- More visual content (illustrations, icons, infographics) alongside text
- A dedicated, simple contact page
- More video content to supplement text-heavy explanations
- Text customization options (font size, spacing controls)
