## First-Person Narrative

### Landing on the Homepage

I typed in launchpadlab.com and the first thing I saw was a large heading: **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."** Underneath it read: *"LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."*

My first impression was mixed. The heading is attention-grabbing—"AI Innovation" and "Results that Matter" are the right themes for me. I'm here because my board is breathing down my neck about AI, and I want results, not buzzwords. The subheading mentions "tailored consulting and product development services," which sounds promising. But "harness the power of AI" is exactly the kind of vague language I've been hearing at every conference this year. Power to do what, exactly? For whom? I don't know yet. I need specifics.

There's a button that says **"Connect with an Expert"** which is reassuring—I'd rather talk to a person than dig through marketing copy. But I want to understand more before I reach out. I'm not going to call someone cold without knowing what they actually do.

### Trust Signals on the Homepage

Scrolling down, I was pleased to see **"Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses"** with logos including Kawasaki Engines, Harvard University, Whirlpool, Northwestern University, CDK Global, Lurie Children's Hospital, and MD Anderson Cancer Center. These are serious organizations—not startups I've never heard of. That builds credibility for me. As someone who has been running a business for 25 years, I know that working with institutions like Harvard and major hospitals means you have to meet real standards.

However, I noticed there are no insurance company logos in this row. No Allstate, no Nationwide, no regional brokerages. That's a small flag—I want to know they understand my world.

### The "Your Strategic AI Partner" Section

The next major heading was **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."** The text said: *"At LaunchPad Lab, we combine deep expertise in product design and development with cutting-edge AI consulting to solve critical business challenges. We've helped hundreds of businesses across all industries solve complex problems that go beyond just ROI."*

"Cutting-edge AI consulting" still feels vague to me. What does AI consulting actually involve? Is someone going to come to my office and explain what AI can do for my claims processing? Or is this a technical engagement where they assume I already know what a "large language model" is? The phrase "go beyond just ROI" is curious—I actually very much care about ROI. My board will want to see numbers.

### The Services Cards

Below that I found a section titled **"Make AI Your Competitive Advantage"** with cards for their different services. The first one caught my eye immediately: **"AI Automation & Agentic AI"** with the subtitle "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce." I clicked through to this page because AI automation is what I've been hearing about at conferences.

The other cards were:
- **Web Application Development** — "Bespoke, redefining experiences"
- **Mobile Application Development** — "Meeting users where they are"  
- **Salesforce Development** — "Solving business problems"
- **Product Strategy & Design** — "Agile, cross-functional expertise"
- **Managed Services & Support** — "Operating as an extension of your team"

These are fine, but the subtitles are very generic. "Bespoke, redefining experiences" doesn't tell me anything. And what does "Agentic AI" mean? I've heard the term at a Salesforce conference, but I genuinely don't understand what an "autonomous digital workforce" means for my 150-person brokerage. Are we talking about software that replaces my claims adjusters? Software that helps them work faster? I can't tell from a three-word subtitle.

### Statistics on the Homepage

I appreciated the hard numbers: **12+ Years in Business, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients** with a note that "90% work with us for longer than one year." These numbers are meaningful to me. Twelve years isn't as long as my own company, but it's enough to show they're not fly-by-night. The 90% retention rate is genuinely impressive—that suggests clients are happy enough to keep coming back. I noted this down for my comparison.

### The Engagement Process

I found a section called **"Accelerate Digital Product Speed to Market"** with a three-phase process: **Discover → Deliver → Release.** Under "Discover" they mention "Research & Define: Align on scope, priorities, including outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept." Under "Deliver" it's about building iteratively with bi-weekly sprint releases. Under "Release" it's about deploying and ongoing support.

This is helpful. I can picture what working with them looks like. The bi-weekly demos remind me of how we've worked with other vendors—I like being able to see progress regularly. But this describes their general software process. What does the AI engagement specifically look like? I didn't see a distinct AI-specific process here on the homepage.

### The "Put AI to Work" Section

Further down, a section titled **"Transform how your business operates with custom AI solutions"** said: *"The companies pulling ahead are using AI to automate repetitive work, improve decision-making, and deliver experiences their competitors can't match. We help you build AI that fits your business and integrates with your existing systems."*

Now this is speaking my language. "Automate repetitive work" — yes, my team spends hours on data entry and routine claims processing. "Improve decision-making" — yes, I'd love data-driven underwriting insights. "Integrates with your existing systems" — critical, because we can't rip and replace everything. But again, it's high-level. What does "custom AI solutions" actually look like for an insurance brokerage? I clicked "Learn More" to go to the AI Automation page.

---

### The AI Automation & Agentic AI Page

The hero text read: **"Transform Business Operations with AI Automation and Agentic AI."** The body copy said: *"AI automation and an agentic workforce remove bottlenecks with speed and scale. Businesses are seeing significant returns with increased operational efficiency, improved customer satisfaction, and enhanced decision-making capabilities."*

There's a button to **"Book an AI Automation Assessment"** which is much more specific than a generic contact form. That's good—an "assessment" implies they'll evaluate my specific needs.

Under "What We Do," the heading is **"AI Automation and Agentic Work Built for Speed and Scale."** The copy mentions: *"We know how to shift from manual processes to high-rev automated workflows that scale your operations... with our proprietary framework, we help businesses train, deploy, and scale autonomous AI agents."*

Here I need to pause. "Autonomous AI agents"—what does that actually mean? Is this software that can process an insurance claim start to finish without a human? Is it a chatbot that answers policyholder questions? The page describes it as "Train digital agents to act independently—accessing data, following logic, and escalating when needed." That last part—"escalating when needed"—is reassuring. It means a human is still in the loop. But I'm still guessing at what this looks like in practice for my business.

The five capability areas listed were:
1. **Autonomous Automation** — "AI automates repetitive, rules-based processes or tasks like intake, triage, and documentation."
2. **Agentic AI Deployment** — "Train digital agents to act independently."
3. **Integrated Data Workflows** — "Connect systems to give AI agents and your teams access to clean, actionable data."
4. **Business Logic Codification** — "Convert human knowledge into repeatable prompts and workflows."
5. **Rapid AI Rollouts** — "From concept to launch in 6 weeks."

"Intake, triage, and documentation" — now THAT resonates with me. My team processes hundreds of intake forms every week. If AI could handle the initial sorting and data entry, that would free up my people to focus on client relationships. But "business logic codification" and "repeatable prompts" are jargon I don't fully understand. What's a "prompt" in this context? Is that a computer programming thing?

The **"Problems We Solve" table** was excellent — each row showed a pain point and its solution:
- "Slow, Manual Processes → Intelligent automation that executes with precision and speed."
- "Siloed, Disconnected Systems → Integrated AI that pulls data from across your stack in real time."
- "Limited Team Capacity → Autonomous agents that scale tasks without adding headcount."

That last one is exactly what I need. We're growing but I can't justify hiring another 20 people. If AI can scale our capacity without adding headcount, that's a real business case I can take to the board.

The **statistics** were compelling: **60%+ reduction in repetitive manual work, 3x faster response across service channels, 6 weeks to deploy a working AI solution.** These are the kinds of numbers my board wants. But I'd like to know where these numbers came from—are they from a specific client? An average across all clients? Without attribution, I'm cautious about trusting them.

The **"Our Signature Approach" for AI** was the most useful thing I found:
1. **AI Opportunity Workshop** (Free) — "Identify pain points, set goals, and align stakeholders in one session."
2. **Proof of Concept** (3-4 weeks) — "Build and test a real AI solution tied to business outcomes."
3. **Production Deployment** (2-3 months) — "Roll out trained agents and automation pipelines, fully integrated."
4. **Ongoing Optimization** — "Enhance performance, accuracy, and coverage over time."

This is exactly the kind of step-by-step process I need to see. A free workshop to start? That's very appealing. I can bring my operations VP and our IT person to a workshop, see if there's a real opportunity, and then decide whether to invest further. Three to four weeks for a proof of concept is fast enough that I'm not committing six months before seeing any results. This gave me real confidence.

There were case studies linked: **Bullhorn, Kawasaki, and Prosci.** None of these are insurance companies. I noted this as a gap.

The FAQ section had questions like "What is agentic AI?" and "Do I need to change my tech stack?" These are exactly the questions I have, but I noticed they were collapsed and I couldn't easily expand them. A missed opportunity—if you're going to anticipate my questions, let me see the answers easily.

The page repeatedly mentioned **Agentforce** and **Salesforce**. I use Salesforce at my company for our CRM, so this isn't completely foreign, but the tight coupling of their AI offering to Salesforce's Agentforce product concerns me slightly. Is their AI offering only for Salesforce customers? What if I wanted to automate something outside of Salesforce?

### The Services Overview Page

I navigated to the main Services page. The heading was **"AI-Centered Digital Product Development."** I noticed "Discovery Space Navigator"—described as a "3-Step Blueprint for What to Build" where they use "Mission Control—our proprietary AI tool built to pinpoint the highest-impact opportunities." This sounds intriguing—a structured way to figure out what to build first. But "Mission Control" is their internal tool name, and it doesn't tell me what it actually does or how it works.

The page showed they deliver in **2 sprints to build a prototype, 6 weeks or less to launch, and 5x faster time to market.** Again, compelling numbers but unattributed.

---

### The Industries Page

I was very intentional about visiting the Industries page. The heading said: **"Digital Experiences Reshaping Industries Powered by AI."** The listed industries were: Financial Services, Private Equity, Healthcare, Professional Services, **Insurance**, Technology, Legal, Knowledge/Education, and Social Impact.

I was thrilled to see **Insurance** listed explicitly. The description read: *"From quote-to-bind workflows and regulatory compliance to digital policyholder servicing."* This tells me they at least understand insurance terminology. I clicked through immediately.

### The Insurance Industry Page

This was the most relevant page for me. The heading: **"Digital Transformation for Insurance Carriers, Brokers & Advisors."** The subheading: *"From quote-to-bind workflows and regulatory compliance to digital policyholder servicing, LaunchPad Lab helps insurance carriers, brokers, and advisors streamline operations, reduce friction, and accelerate growth with secure, scalable software."*

They're speaking directly to me—"insurance carriers, brokers, and advisors." That's exactly what my company is: a brokerage.

The **services listed for insurance** were highly specific:
1. **Quote-to-Bind Automation** — "Enable real-time quoting and API-connected binding."
2. **Broker and FMO Distribution Platforms** — "End-to-end tools for agent onboarding, lead management, and quoting."
3. **Claims Intake and Risk Management Tools** — "Digitize claims intake and risk assessments."
4. **Digital Self-Service Portals for Policyholders** — "Give customers control."
5. **Regulatory Compliance Automation** — "Reduce audit risk."

Every single one of these is relevant to my business. This is the most concrete, specific content I've found on the entire site. I can picture what each of these means for my operations.

The **insurance-specific statistics** were very strong:
- **140% increase in online conversions** via custom platform
- **5,000+ insurance agents supported** via sales portal
- **$2M in projected profit** from automated actuarial data processing

These are real, tangible outcomes. The $2M projected profit from an actuarial firm using AI-workflows is exactly the kind of proof my board needs. However, I noticed these stats aren't attributed to named companies—they say "projected profit" which means it hasn't been fully realized yet.

The insurance page's **engagement process** includes a "Discovery Space Navigator," "Blueprint Workshops," "Agile Product Development," "System Integrations & Salesforce," and "Post-Launch Support." This is clear and logical.

Case studies linked from this page included **Senior Market Advisors** (built a digital sales portal for 5,000+ medicare brokers), an **Actuarial Firm** (projects $2M profit increase with AI workflows), and **Select Home Warranty** (140% lift in conversions). The actuarial firm one is closest to my world.

One thing missing: there's no mention of AI specifically on the insurance page's service descriptions. The services are about digital transformation broadly—quoting, claims, compliance—but I came here looking for what AI can do for insurance specifically. The AI Automation page doesn't mention insurance, and the Insurance page doesn't deeply discuss AI. These two narratives feel disconnected.

---

### The Our Work Page

The Our Work page listed dozens of case studies. I used the filter option and scanned for relevant ones. I found:
- **Healthcare Insurance Platform** — "How a Healthcare Insurance Platform Used AI Automation to Streamline Claim Reviews"
- **Actuarial Firm** — "How an Actuarial Firm Projects $2M Profit Increase with AI-Workflows"
- **Financial Services Firm** — "How AI Process Automation Enhanced Efficiency for a Leading Consumer Lender"

I clicked into the **Healthcare Insurance Platform** case study. This was excellent. The challenge described nurse reviewers manually evaluating unstructured clinical documents—faxed, typed, and handwritten records—to determine medical necessity. The pain points listed (slow turnaround, inconsistent evaluations, rapid volume increase) are very similar to what my claims team faces.

The solution involved AI document processing that extracts patient details from unstructured documents, matches them against clinical guidelines, generates structured recommendation drafts, and logs everything for compliance. The results were impressive: **review time reduced from 3-4 days to under 24 hours, 85-90% accuracy rating, and nurses can process more cases without adding headcount.**

This is exactly the kind of concrete example I've been looking for. If they could do something similar for my brokerage—automating the initial review of claims documents, matching them against our underwriting guidelines—that would be transformational. But I notice the company name is anonymized ("a healthcare insurance technology platform"), which slightly reduces my confidence. I'd prefer to see the actual company name.

### The Contact Page

The Contact page heading says **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** with a simple form asking for First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, and "How Can We Help You?" This is acceptable but quite generic. For a company president making a potentially six-figure decision, I'd expect more. Perhaps a way to schedule a call directly, or an option to specify my role and the nature of my inquiry. The one text field for "How Can We Help You?" doesn't guide me at all.

I was pleased to find testimonials on the contact page. The one from Patrick West, Vice President of Apex Leaders, said: *"I think everybody here has been really impressed and really happy with where the app is going. We trust that any crazy idea we cook up, you guys can really digest and say how it can be feasible, which is great."* That's genuine-sounding, though I'd prefer testimonials from people at my level—CEOs, presidents—and in my industry.

The contact section below the form showed **Email (contact@launchpadlab.com), Phone ((312) 888-9651), and LinkedIn.** Having a phone number is very important to me. I may actually call rather than fill out the form. Chicago-based is also a plus—they're in the Midwest like me, and I can picture meeting them in person.

---

### The About Us Page

The About page confirmed they've been in business **since 2012** (13+ years now) and have worked with **240+ clients** on **730+ projects.** They have a **4.8/5 rating on Clutch** and badges for "Top Salesforce Company 2023" and "Top Software Developers United States 2023."

The leadership team is listed with LinkedIn profiles: **Scott Weisman (Co-Founder & CEO), Ryan Francis (Partner, President, & Head of Sales), Brendan Hennessy (Co-Founder & CTO),** and others. Seeing real names and faces builds trust. The team is substantial—I can see product managers, engineering managers, a VP of Design, a VP of Client Growth. This looks like a real, established company.

One thing that puzzled me on the About page: under "On the Cutting Edge," they wrote: *"From AI like ChatGPT to Salesforce products like Agentforce, we're on the cutting edge to bring you into the future."* Mentioning ChatGPT by name feels slightly casual for an enterprise audience. It's like saying "we use Google"—it doesn't tell me about their expertise. I'd rather hear about their proprietary methodology or specific AI capabilities.

## Summary Assessment

### Did I achieve my goals?

**Goal 1: Understand what AI services they offer and whether they could help my insurance business.**  
Partially. I now understand they offer AI automation, particularly around document processing and workflow automation, and they have a specific process (workshop → proof of concept → deployment). I found a highly relevant case study (healthcare insurance claims). And their insurance industry page showed real understanding of my world. But the AI and insurance narratives are disconnected—I had to piece together the story myself across multiple pages. There was no single page that said: "Here's what AI can do for insurance brokerages like yours."

**Goal 2: Find how to contact them and start a conversation about AI strategy.**  
Yes. Multiple contact options are available—form, phone, email. The "Book an AI Automation Assessment" CTA on the AI page was the most relevant entry point. The free AI Opportunity Workshop is very appealing.

### Would I recommend them to my board?

**Tentatively yes**, with caveats. I'd tell my board: "This Chicago-based firm has been around 13 years, has worked with 240+ companies including Harvard and Whirlpool, has specific insurance industry experience, and offers a free AI workshop to start. They have a case study showing AI reduced insurance claim review time from 3-4 days to 24 hours. I'd like to book the workshop and see if they can do something similar for us."

The caveats: I still don't fully understand what "agentic AI" means in concrete terms, the statistics on the AI page are unattributed, and I would have liked to see more insurance-specific AI examples rather than having to hunt across different sections. I also need to understand pricing before making any commitment.

### What worked well?

1. The insurance-specific industry page with concrete service descriptions (quote-to-bind, claims intake, compliance automation)
2. The healthcare insurance case study with real, measurable outcomes
3. The clear engagement process (free workshop → proof of concept → deployment)
4. Strong trust signals (13+ years, 240+ clients, 4.8/5 Clutch rating, recognizable logos)
5. Phone number and email prominently available
6. The "Problems We Solve" tables showing pain point → solution format

### What didn't work?

1. Jargon without explanation: "agentic AI," "autonomous digital workforce," "business logic codification," "repeatable prompts" — these mean nothing to me
2. AI and insurance content are siloed — no page brings them together as "AI for Insurance"
3. Unattributed statistics (60%+ reduction, 3x faster) — where do these come from?
4. Anonymous case studies reduce trust — I'd rather see company names
5. Heavy Salesforce/Agentforce coupling — unclear if AI services work outside Salesforce ecosystem
6. Generic contact form doesn't recognize the seriousness of an enterprise inquiry
7. No pricing guidance or even ranges anywhere on the site
8. The "ChatGPT" name-drop on the About page feels casual, not expert
9. FAQ sections were collapsed and I couldn't expand them easily

### What specific changes would help someone like me?

1. **Create an "AI for Insurance" page** that combines the insurance industry knowledge with specific AI use cases. Show me: "Here are 5 ways AI can transform your brokerage."
2. **Define jargon inline.** When you say "agentic AI," add a parenthetical: "(software agents that can handle tasks like processing claims or answering customer questions automatically, with human oversight)."
3. **Attribute your statistics** to specific case studies or provide methodology.
4. **Add executive-level testimonials** from insurance/financial services leaders.
5. **Offer a "Schedule a Call" button** in addition to the form, ideally with calendar integration.
6. **Clarify whether AI services require Salesforce** or work independently.
7. **Add a "How AI Works" explainer** for business leaders—a 60-second primer that assumes no technical knowledge.
