---

## The Homepage — First Impressions

Okay so I just landed on launchpadlab.com and... the first thing I see is this big hero section with a photo of people sitting around a conference table with laptops. It's giving very... office-meeting energy. Like, stock-photo-adjacent. The people look professional, but it doesn't feel like *my* world. It's not ugly, but it's not giving Notion or Linear vibes either. The design is clean — white background, blue accents, bold serif-ish typography for the headline — but it feels more "corporate consulting firm" than "cool tech studio."

The headline reads: **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."** Honestly? That's three buzzphrases stacked on top of each other and none of them tell me anything. "AI Innovation" — okay, but what does that mean for me? "Digital Solutions" — that's so vague it could mean literally anything. "Results that Matter" — sure, but whose results? This feels like it was written for a boardroom presentation, not for someone like me who's trying to figure out if these people can build my app.

Then there's the subtext: *"LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services."* The word "organizations" immediately puts distance between me and this company. I'm not an "organization" — I'm a 22-year-old with an idea and $5K in savings. "Harness the power of AI" and "tailored consulting" — this is corporate jargon 101. I'm already feeling like I'm not the target customer here.

The CTA button says **"Connect with an Expert."** That's... fine? But "expert" feels formal. I'd rather it say something like "Let's Talk" or "Tell Us About Your Idea." The word "expert" makes me feel like I need to have my act together before I even reach out.

## Scrolling the Homepage — Social Feed Style

I scroll down fast, like I would on TikTok or Instagram. First thing I hit: **"Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses"** with a row of client logos. I see Prosci, Whirlpool, Northwestern University, CDK Global, Children's Hospital of Chicago, Indiana University. Okay — these are all big institutions and corporations. I don't recognize most of these. Whirlpool makes appliances? CDK Global? Never heard of them. There's no startup here. There's no consumer app. There's no company that looks like anything I'd use or follow. This immediately signals to me: this company works with *big companies*, not someone like me.

Then there's a video section with some guy in a blazer talking, and next to it: **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."** Enterprise! There it is. The word "enterprise" is basically a neon sign that says "this isn't for you, Zara." The paragraph talks about "cross-functional teams" and "cutting-edge AI consulting." I scroll right past this. Wall of text, corporate language — not for me.

Next section: **"Make AI Your Competitive Advantage."** More AI talk. "Since 2012, LaunchPad Lab has empowered companies by delivering transformative, bottom-line impact." Transformative bottom-line impact? Who talks like this? This feels like it belongs in a pitch deck for investors, not on a website trying to attract clients. And the service cards below — AI Automation & Agentic AI, Web Application Development, Mobile Application Development, Salesforce Development, Product Strategy & Design, Managed Services & Support. The web and mobile app development ones are relevant to me, but they're buried next to "Salesforce Development" and "Agentic AI," which I literally have no context for.

I keep scrolling. **"Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast"** — okay, the "ship fast" part speaks to me, but then the tabs underneath say things like "Operational Efficiency," "Modern Technology," "Expansive Resources." These are corporate priorities. Where's the tab for "I have an idea and I need to make it real"? The screenshot next to it shows what looks like some kind of enterprise dashboard for an auto dealership. This is so far from what I'm building.

## The Stats and Process Section

The stats section caught my eye briefly: **12+ years in business, 730+ projects, 240+ clients.** Those are legit numbers. That's actual social proof. But 240+ clients over 12 years and all the logos I see are enterprise companies — this tells me they're an established enterprise shop, not a startup-friendly studio.

Then there's **"Our Signature Approach: Accelerate Digital Product Speed to Market."** The process section shows Discover → Deliver → Release with steps like "Research & Define," "Development," "QA Testing," "Deploy," "Ongoing Support." The Development step mentions "bi-weekly sprint releases" and the QA step mentions "UAT validation." I literally don't know what UAT means. "Sprint" is something I've heard but wouldn't know what it actually involves. This section would be way more useful if it explained the process in plain language — like "We figure out what to build, then we build it in small pieces so you can see progress every two weeks, then we launch it."

The dark blue design of this section actually looks pretty nice visually. That's probably the best-designed section on the homepage.

## Case Studies

The case studies carousel shows Millennium Trust Company ("Spurring Enterprise Innovation"), Prosci ("360-Customer View in Salesforce"), and CDK Global ("Sales Discovery Portal for Automotive Companies"). Again — every single case study is enterprise. Financial services. Salesforce implementations. Automotive portals. None of these are consumer apps. None of these are startups. None of these are marketplaces or social platforms. I'm looking for a signal — *any* signal — that says "we've helped someone like you build something like what you want." I see none.

## The Contact Form

The bottom of the homepage has a **"Let's Build Something Great"** section with a form. The form asks for: First Name, Last Name, **Company Email**, **Company**, and "How Can We Help You?" plus a reCAPTCHA.

"Company Email" — I don't have a company email. I have a Gmail address. This field makes me feel like I'm not welcome here. Same with "Company" — what do I put? "Zara's Startup Idea That Doesn't Have a Name Yet"? This form is clearly designed for people who work at established companies and have business email addresses. It's not designed for a first-time founder.

There's no chat widget anywhere on the site. No Calendly link. No "book a quick call" option. No DM option. Just this formal corporate form with a reCAPTCHA and a "Submit" button. After I submit, what happens? "We will get in touch with you as soon as possible." That's incredibly vague. Is that tomorrow? Next week? A month? This feels like shouting into a void. I have no idea what the next step looks like and that makes me anxious about even filling it out.

## The Footer and Social Links

The footer has links to Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn under "Let's Get Social." No TikTok, no Twitter/X. Facebook in 2026? Who is that for? Their address is in Chicago — 2045 W Grand Ave. They have a phone number. There's a Clutch review badge (4.8 stars, 42 reviews) and an AgencyReview 10.0 score. The review scores are nice — that's actual social proof. But it's presented very small and subtle at the bottom.

## The About Page

I clicked over to the About page. Hero image: three guys standing in an office/conference room. Again — office energy. The headline says **"Our Award-Winning Digital Product Firm."** "Award-winning" is fine, "digital product firm" is a bit generic.

Scrolling down, there's a section called **"We Help Unleash Your Digital Potential"** with a bunch of Clutch badges — "Top Salesforce Company 2023," "Top Software Developers," "Top 1000 Companies." Cool, but these badges mean nothing to me. I don't know what Clutch is. These are B2B industry awards that someone in procurement might care about, but for me they're just gray logos I scroll past.

Then the **"Meet Our Leadership Team"** section. There are photos of about 15 people. Scott Weisman (Co Founder & CEO), Ryan Francis (Partner, President, & Head of Sales), Brendan Hennessy (Co Founder & CTO), Monique Silva (VP of Design), and so on. The circular photo treatment is nice. But the titles are very corporate: VP, President, Head of Delivery, Principal Software Architect II. None of these people have bios or short descriptions about their personality or what they're passionate about. They all link to LinkedIn. This feels like a corporate directory, not a team page. I want to see human beings — what do they care about? What do they build for fun? A team page on a site like Vercel feels alive. This feels like an org chart.

## The Our Work Page

I went to the Our Work page. It has a grid of case studies — a LOT of them. The hero says **"Our Work & Case Studies"** with a background image of a phone and laptop. There's a "Filter By: Select Industries" dropdown.

The case studies include: Kawasaki ("Optimized Workflows with a Self-Service Portal"), Bullhorn ("AI-Enhanced Self-Service Hub"), MD Anderson ("Advanced Cancer Research"), Whirlpool ("Transformed Its Testing Labs"), Financial Services Firm, Healthcare Insurance Platform, Biotech Organization, Actuarial Firm, Wealth Management Firm... I kept scrolling.

Then I found some that are slightly more interesting: Harvard ("Next Gen Web-Based Application"), Tiny House Listings ("Digital App Accelerated Growth"), Breadcrumb ("10 Million Views with New App Debut"), Guild Row ("Mobile-First Member App"), Prepmedians ("Engaging, Test-Ready Digital Tools"), AlgoFast ("Event-based Trading for the Average Investor"), NextLot ("Scaled to $2B+ with a Custom Auction Platform"). Now THESE are more my vibe. Tiny House Listings, Breadcrumb, AlgoFast, NextLot — these sound like startups or at least startup-adjacent. But they're buried so far down the page that I almost didn't see them. If I were scrolling on my phone, I would have bounced long before reaching them.

There's no "Startups" filter in the industry dropdown. There's no way to quickly see "here's what we've built for early-stage companies." The first 8 case studies are all enterprise, and that shapes my entire perception.

## The Contact Page

The Contact page hero: **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** with the subtext "Complete the form below to tell us about your project. We will get in touch with you as soon as possible." Same form as before — First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, How Can We Help You, reCAPTCHA, Submit.

Below the form there are testimonials from clients. The one I saw: *"I think everybody here has been really impressed and really happy with where the app is going. We trust that any crazy idea we cook up, you guys can really digest and say how it can be feasible."* — Patrick West, VP of Apex Leaders. This is actually a nice quote — it makes them sound approachable and creative. But it's from a VP. I want to hear from a founder. A first-timer. Someone who was in my shoes.

Then at the bottom: **"Let's Connect"** with three options — Email (contact@launchpadlab.com), Call (312-888-9651), and Connect with Us on LinkedIn. Email and phone feel old-school but at least they're real. No Calendly, no chat, no "book a 15-minute intro call." The LinkedIn option is fine but it's not where I'd naturally go to talk to a company about building my app.

## Instagram Check

I checked their Instagram. **@launchpadlab** — 463 posts, **250 followers**, 148 following. 250 followers?? For a company that's been around 13 years? That's genuinely concerning. My personal TikTok has 10K followers and I'm just a college grad with a side project. Their recent posts: a "Happy Holidays" cartoon from December 2025, a Clutch award reel, a "13 Years in Business" celebration graphic. The content is very corporate — award announcements and milestone celebrations. There's nothing engaging, no behind-the-scenes content, no personality, no reels showing their work process, no client stories. The last post was from December 2025 — that's almost two months with no activity. The Instagram is basically dead. This is a red flag for me.

## The Services Page

I also briefly checked the Services page. **"AI-Centered Digital Product Development"** — again with the "cross-functional teams" and "full digital product lifecycle" language. There's a section called **"Discovery Space Navigator"** that sounded interesting — "Your 3-Step Blueprint for What to Build" — with stats like "2 Sprints to Build a Prototype" and "6 Weeks or Less to Launch." This is actually the closest thing to a startup-friendly offering I found on the entire site. But it's buried deep on the services page and I almost missed it.

There's also an FAQ section at the very bottom with a question: **"How much does it cost to build a custom software solution?"** — but it's collapsed and I couldn't easily see the answer. The fact that pricing info exists is good, but it needs to be way more prominent. Someone like me is ANXIOUS about cost. I need to know if this is a $10K thing or a $500K thing before I even think about filling out that form.

## Did I Achieve My Goals?

**Goal 1: Figure out if LaunchPad Lab could help build my app.**
Kind of? They clearly build web and mobile apps — that's literally what I need. But everything about the site makes me feel like they build apps for enterprises, not for someone like me. The case studies are enterprise-focused. The language is enterprise-focused. The client logos are enterprise-focused. I *think* they could help me, but I don't *feel* welcome.

**Goal 2: Find a comfortable way to contact them.**
No. The only contact option is a corporate form that asks for a "Company Email" and "Company Name" — both of which make me feel excluded. There's no chat, no Calendly, no casual way to reach out. I'd be filling out a form that's designed for a VP of Product at a Fortune 500 company, and then waiting an indefinite amount of time for someone to get back to me. That doesn't feel comfortable at all.

## Would I Actually Reach Out?

**Probably not.** Here's the thing — the work they do is impressive. 730+ projects, 12+ years, real case studies with real results. If I somehow knew they worked with startups and had a rough idea of pricing, I'd probably reach out. But the entire experience makes me feel like I'm not their customer. I'd keep Googling and look for an agency that explicitly says "we build apps for startups" or "we work with first-time founders." Or I'd probably go try a no-code tool first because at least that feels accessible.

## What Would Make Me Feel Welcome — Specific Changes

1. **Add a "Startups" or "Early-Stage" section prominently on the homepage.** Even a single sentence: "We work with everyone from first-time founders to Fortune 500 companies" would change my entire perception.

2. **Fix the contact form.** Change "Company Email" to just "Email." Change "Company" to "Company (optional)" or just remove it. Add a "What stage are you at?" dropdown with options like "Just an idea," "Early prototype," "Growing business," "Enterprise." This would make non-corporate people feel included.

3. **Add a Calendly link or chat widget.** Let me book a 15-minute call. That's so much less intimidating than a form that disappears into a void.

4. **Put startup-friendly case studies first.** Tiny House Listings, Breadcrumb, AlgoFast, NextLot — these are relatable. Lead with them or at least make them easily filterable.

5. **Show pricing ranges.** Even something like "Projects typically start at $XX,XXX" would help me understand if this is in my universe. Right now I have zero frame of reference.

6. **Kill the corporate jargon.** "Digital transformation," "cross-functional teams," "enterprise solutions," "leveraging AI," "bottom-line impact" — replace all of this with human language. Talk to me like a person, not like a consulting proposal.

7. **Fix the Instagram.** 250 followers and no posts in two months? Either invest in it or remove the link. A dead Instagram hurts more than no Instagram.

8. **Add a TikTok or at least Twitter/X.** Facebook and LinkedIn are not where my generation discovers or evaluates companies.

9. **Make the team page more human.** Add short bios, fun facts, or photos that don't look like corporate headshots. Show personality.

10. **The "Discovery Space Navigator" offering should be front and center.** "2 Sprints to Build a Prototype, 6 Weeks or Less to Launch" — that's exactly what someone like me needs to hear. Why is it buried on the services page?
