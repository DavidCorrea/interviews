## First-Person Narrative

### Landing on the Homepage

Okay, I just pulled up launchpadlab.com. Let me see what's going on here.

First thing I see — huge bold text: **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."** That's big, that's punchy, I like it. My eyes go straight to that. Below it there's a paragraph, but honestly, it's like four lines long and I'm already scanning past it. I catch a few words — "AI," "consulting," "product development," "modernize operations." Cool. So they build digital stuff with AI. Got it. That was fast — maybe 10 seconds.

There's a blue-outlined button that says **"Connect with an Expert"** right below the text. That's nice and visible. If I wanted to contact them right now, I could click that. Good. I also spot **"CONTACT"** in the top-right corner of the navigation bar — it's styled differently from the other nav items, like it has a border around it. That stands out. Two ways to contact them already visible on the first screen. That's solid.

The background image is a photo of people working at laptops around a table. Looks like a real team, not stock photos. It gives me a vibe that they're collaborative, not a massive faceless corporation. I like that.

Now, the nav bar at the top — Services, Technologies, Industries, Our Work, About Us, Insights, Contact. That's seven items. I'm scanning them but not really reading them. My eyes bounce between "Our Work" and "Services" and "Contact." Those are the ones that matter to me.

### Scrolling Down the Homepage

I start scrolling. There's a section that says **"Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses"** with a row of logos — Kawasaki, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, Harvard, Prosci, Whirlpool, Northwestern, CDK Global, Lurie Children's Hospital, Indiana University, MD Anderson. Okay, those are impressive names. That makes me feel like these people are legit. I don't read any text here, I just clock the logos and keep going.

Next section — wait, there's an iframe here. Something is loading. I can't tell what it is but I'm already past it mentally.

Then I see **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise"** — another big heading. Below it there's a paragraph. I catch "product design and development" and "AI consulting." But the paragraph is long. I skip it. My brain literally just glazes over dense paragraph text like that. I need bullet points, bolded keywords, something to grab onto. This paragraph gives me nothing to anchor to.

Below that there's a section called **"Make AI Your Competitive Advantage"** with six cards:
- AI Automation & Agentic AI
- Web Application Development
- Mobile Application Development
- Salesforce Development
- Product Strategy & Design
- Managed Services & Support

Each card has a short one-liner description and a "Learn More" link. This is GREAT. This is exactly what my brain needs — short labels, clear categories, visual separation. I can immediately see what services they offer. The one-liners are like "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce" and "Meeting users where they are." Quick, digestible. Love it.

But then something catches my eye...

### Getting Distracted by the Tab Section

There's a tabbed section below called **"Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast"** with tabs for Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement, Scalable Solutions, Expansive Resources, and Speed to Market. The first tab is selected and shows "Streamline processes with digital products to enhance productivity."

On the right side, there are these cool-looking screenshots of what appears to be an app interface — a dashboard with charts and a satellite map view. Ooh, that's visually interesting. I find myself staring at the screenshots instead of reading the tab content. I click through a couple of the tabs just to see if the images change. I'm not really processing what each tab says — I'm just clicking because the interactive element is engaging.

Wait, what was I doing? Oh right, figuring out what they do and how to contact them. I already have a decent idea of what they do, so let me keep scrolling.

### The Stats Section

Big bold numbers: **12+ Years in Business, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients.** These jump out at me immediately. The numbers are huge, like display-size font. I read these instantly. "90% work with us for longer than one year" — that's a nice stat. This section is perfectly designed for someone like me. Big numbers, short labels, done.

### The Process Section

There's a section about their approach — Discover, Deliver, Release — with sub-steps like Research & Define, Development, QA Testing, Deploy, Ongoing Support. I skim the headings. The paragraph text under each heading? Skipped entirely. But the three-phase structure is clear enough. I get it — they have a process.

### Case Studies Carousel

I scroll into a section called **"We Help Shape Our Clients' Digital Future"** with a carousel showing case studies. I see Millennium Trust Company, Prosci, and CDK Global. Each has metrics like "3 New Innovative Digital Products" and "$1M+ New Annual Revenue." The stats are catchy. I almost click on the Millennium Trust case study because the numbers are impressive, but I stop myself. I need to stay on task — contact info.

Wait, actually, let me click "Our Work" in the nav. I'm curious.

### Our Work Page — Overwhelming

I click over to the Our Work page and... whoa. It's a massive grid of case studies. I count — there must be 40+ case study cards here. Kawasaki, Bullhorn, MD Anderson, Whirlpool, Financial Services Firm, Healthcare Insurance Platform, Resilience-Supportive Schools Illinois, Biotech Organization, Actuarial Firm... the list goes on and on and on.

Each card has a company name, a heading describing what they did, and presumably an image. But there's SO MANY of them. I feel overwhelmed. There's a filter button at the top that says "Select Industries" but I don't even want to filter — I just wanted to get a quick sense of their work. Instead, I'm staring at this endless wall of case studies and my brain is shutting down.

I do notice some interesting ones — "How MD Anderson Advanced Cancer Research with Curefaster" and "How NextLot Scaled to $2B+ with a Custom Auction Platform" — but I'm not going to click through any of these. There are too many choices and I can't decide where to focus. This is classic ADHD paralysis of choice.

The page doesn't have any summary or highlight section at the top — it just throws you straight into the grid. A "Featured Work" section with 3-4 highlighted case studies before the full list would have been way more manageable for me.

### Services Page — More Dense Content

I navigate to the Services page. Big hero text: **"AI-Centered Digital Product Development."** Paragraph below. I skip the paragraph. Below, there are the same six service categories I saw on the homepage, but this time with longer descriptions. Each service has a paragraph of text and a "Learn More" link.

The descriptions are 2-3 sentences long, which is on the edge of what I'll read. I skim the first couple words of each — "Leverage AI automation capabilities..." nope, too jargon-heavy. "Build an intuitive, user-friendly digital product..." okay, I get it. "Deliver a world-class mobile experience..." good.

There's an accordion section below called "Advance with Modern Tech Solutions" with expandable items for Business, IT, and Users. I see the Business one is already expanded with bullet points. Bullet points! Yes! Those I can read. "Speed to market brings features to customers quicker." "Future-proof your business with digital product development support." Quick hits. I like those.

Further down, there's a "Discovery Space Navigator" section — something about a 3-step blueprint. The stats say "2 Sprints to Build a Prototype, 6 Weeks or Less to Launch, 5x Faster Time to Market." Those numbers pop. But the paragraph description is dense and I skip it.

Then there's a case studies section and a FAQ section at the bottom. The FAQ has 12 questions. That's a lot of questions, but at least they're in collapsible format so they don't visually overwhelm me all at once.

The Services page also has a contact form at the bottom. Same form as the homepage — First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, How Can We Help You, Submit. Useful that it's on every page.

### Finding Contact Information

Okay, now my main goal — finding contact info. I click "Contact" in the nav bar. The page loads and I see: **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** with a form below. Simple, clear. The form asks for First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, and How Can We Help You. That's five fields. Not too many, not too few. There's a Submit button. Easy enough.

Below the form, there's a testimonials carousel — a quote from some vice president at Apex Leaders. Nice but I don't care about this right now.

Further down, I see a **"Let's Connect"** section with three options:
- **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com
- **Call:** (312) 888-9651
- **LinkedIn:** Connect link

Perfect! This is exactly what I need. Three clear ways to reach them — email, phone, and LinkedIn. The email is a clickable mailto link, the phone is a clickable tel link. No hunting required.

In the footer (which is on every page), I also find their address: 2045 W Grand Ave Ste B PMB 37406, Chicago, Illinois 60612. Plus their phone number again, and links to Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

### About Page — A Quick Scan

I also checked out the About page. Hero says **"Our Award-Winning Digital Product Firm"** — "Since 2012, we've helped over 240 companies across the globe." Good. Clear.

Below that, **"We Help Unleash Your Digital Potential"** with a paragraph. I catch "digital product firm" and "bespoke solutions." The paragraph is medium-length — I skim it.

There are a bunch of Clutch badges and award images. Those look legit but they're small and I can't read the text on them easily. They create visual credibility but I can't tell what specifically they're for without zooming in.

Three bullet-point sections — "Deep Experience," "Holistic Capability," "On the Cutting Edge." Each has a short paragraph. I read the first sentence of each. Good.

Then there's the **"Meet Our Leadership Team"** section with circular headshot photos. I see Scott Weisman (CEO), Ryan Francis (President & Head of Sales), Brendan Hennessy (CTO), Monique Silva (VP of Design), and more. There's about 15 people shown. Each photo links to their LinkedIn. That's a nice touch — puts faces to the company. I appreciate that.

Below the team section, there's a video embed. I don't watch it. Videos require more sustained attention than I have right now.

Then the same stats (13+ years, 730+ projects, 240+ clients) and another case studies carousel. And of course, another contact form at the bottom.

## Goal Assessment

### Goal 1: Figure out what LaunchPad Lab does
**Status: Achieved**

I figured out within the first 15-20 seconds that LaunchPad Lab is a digital product firm that builds web apps, mobile apps, and AI solutions. The homepage hero text made this clear. The service cards reinforced it. I could have gotten even faster clarity if the hero paragraph had been shorter or used bullet points instead of a dense paragraph.

### Goal 2: Find how to contact them
**Status: Achieved**

I found multiple ways to contact them:
- Contact form (on every page — homepage, services, about, and a dedicated Contact page)
- Email: contact@launchpadlab.com
- Phone: (312) 888-9651
- LinkedIn link
- "Connect with an Expert" CTA button on the homepage
- "CONTACT" button in the navigation bar (clearly styled, easy to spot)

The Contact page itself was clean and simple. Finding contact info was one click from any page.

## Summary: What Worked and What Didn't

### What Worked Well
1. **Homepage hero section** — Big, bold headline immediately communicated value. I knew what they did within seconds.
2. **"CONTACT" button in the nav** — Visually distinct from other nav items. Easy to spot.
3. **Service cards on the homepage** — Short labels, clear categories, "Learn More" links. Perfect for scanning.
4. **Big stat numbers** — 12+ years, 730+ projects, 240+ clients. These are eye-catching and quick to absorb.
5. **Contact form on every page** — No matter where I ended up, I could always reach out without navigating away.
6. **Contact page simplicity** — Clean layout with form, email, phone, and LinkedIn. No clutter.
7. **Leadership team photos** — Humanizes the company. Makes it feel approachable.

### What Didn't Work
1. **Dense paragraphs everywhere** — Most section descriptions are 3-5 line paragraphs. I skipped almost all of them. Bullet points or bolded key phrases would help enormously.
2. **Our Work page is overwhelming** — 40+ case studies dumped in a grid with no hierarchy, no featured items, no summary. Paralysis of choice for someone with ADHD.
3. **Jargon-heavy copy** — Phrases like "bespoke solutions," "cross-functional teams," "mission-critical software" are meaningless buzz. Plain language would land better.
4. **Auto-playing carousel on case studies** — The carousel on the homepage and About page auto-advances. This is distracting and I lose track of what I was reading.
5. **Tab section is a distraction trap** — The interactive tabs on the homepage pulled my focus away from my task. The visual screenshots next to the tabs were engaging but ultimately a detour.
6. **Clutch badges are too small** — Can't read what they say. They create visual noise without clear value.
7. **Video embed on About page** — There's an iframe for a video but no indication of how long it is or what it covers. I'm not going to commit to watching something with no preview.
8. **Repetitive content across pages** — The same case study carousel, same stats, same contact form appear on nearly every page. This creates a sense of déjà vu that's disorienting.

### What Would Help Someone Like Me
- Replace paragraphs with bullet points wherever possible
- Add a "Featured Work" section to the Our Work page with 3-5 highlighted projects before the full grid
- Use progressive disclosure — show summaries first, let users expand for details
- Reduce auto-playing elements (carousels, animations) or let users control them
- Use plain language instead of business jargon
- Add estimated read/watch times to videos and long content
- Consider a "Quick Contact" floating button that's always visible
- Break up long pages with clearer visual section breaks
