## The Experience

### Landing on the Homepage

I typed "custom software company Chicago" into Google and LaunchPad Lab came up. I clicked through, and the first thing I see is a big bold headline: **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."**

Okay. "Results that Matter" — that's the only part that speaks to me. "AI Innovation" means nothing to me right now. I don't need AI. I need a system that tracks my inventory so I stop losing clients. "Digital Solutions" is vague. What kind of solutions? For whom? The headline doesn't tell me whether these people build custom software for companies like mine or whether they make phone apps for startups. I'm already a little uncertain.

Below the headline there's a paragraph: *"LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."*

"Product development services" — okay, so they build things. "Modernize operations, reduce costs" — that sounds like what I need. But "harness the power of AI" and "high-impact digital products" — I don't know what a "digital product" is. Is that software? Is that a website? Is that an app? I need someone to build me an inventory management system. Can they do that? I still don't know.

There's a button that says **"Connect with an Expert."** Good. At least I know how to reach out if I decide to. But I'm not ready yet — I need to know if they're the right fit first.

### Client Logos — Finally, Some Credibility

I scroll down and I see **"Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses"** with logos: Kawasaki, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, Harvard University, Whirlpool, Northwestern, CDK Global, Lurie Children's Hospital, Indiana University, MD Anderson Cancer Center. 

Now THIS is what I needed to see. These are real companies. Big names. If they trust these people, maybe I can too. Whirlpool is a manufacturing company — they probably have inventory challenges too. This is the first thing on this site that makes me feel like maybe these people are legit. But why isn't this higher up? Why did I have to scroll past AI marketing jargon to get here?

### The Services Section — Jargon Overload

Next section: **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."** More AI talk. I get it, AI is trendy. But I don't care about AI. I need an inventory system. Can you build me one? 

Below that: **"Make AI Your Competitive Advantage."** And then a list of services:
- **"AI Automation & Agentic AI"** — I don't know what "Agentic AI" means. I don't know what this is.
- **"Web Application Development"** — Okay, THIS sounds more like what I need. "Bespoke, redefining experiences" — what does "bespoke" mean in this context? And "redefining experiences"? I need software, not a philosophy lecture.
- **"Mobile Application Development"** — Maybe eventually, but not my priority right now.
- **"Salesforce Development"** — I've heard of Salesforce. We don't use it. Not sure if this is relevant.
- **"Product Strategy & Design"** — "Agile, cross-functional expertise." I have NO idea what "Agile" means in this context. And "cross-functional"? These are not words I use. This description tells me nothing.
- **"Managed Services & Support"** — Okay, so they provide ongoing support. That's good to know, but the description is full of buzzwords.

### The Process — This Is Helpful, But Uses Jargon

There's a section called **"Accelerate Digital Product Speed to Market"** with a process: **Discover → Deliver → Release.**

Under Discover: "Research & Define — Align on scope, priorities, including outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept." Okay, "scope" and "priorities" I understand. "Proof of concept" — I think I know what that means. "Roadmap" — fine. But this is buried in a lot of words.

Under Deliver: "Development — Build iteratively with bi-weekly sprint releases." What are "sprint releases"? I don't know what a "sprint" is. Why can't they just say "We build the software in stages and show you progress every two weeks"? And "QA Testing" — "UAT validation ensures nothing goes unchecked." What is "UAT"? I feel like I need a dictionary to read this website.

Under Release: "Deploy — Ship the product to market." Okay, so they deliver the finished product. And "Ongoing Support" — good, they don't just disappear.

This process section is actually useful — it's the closest thing to answering "What happens after I contact you?" But the jargon undermines it. I'm a CEO, not a project manager. Speak to me like a human being.

### Numbers That Build Confidence

I see: **12+ Years in Business. 730+ Projects. 240+ Clients.** And 90% of clients work with them for longer than a year. NOW we're talking. These are concrete numbers. This is what I need to see. Twelve years means they're not going anywhere. 730 projects means they've done this before. 90% retention means their clients are happy. This section is excellent and should be much more prominent.

### Case Studies — Good, But Not My Industry

There are case studies: Millennium Trust Company ("Spurring Enterprise Innovation"), Prosci ("360-Customer View in Salesforce"), CDK Global ("Sales Discovery Portal for Automotive Companies"). These are real projects with real numbers — $1M+ in new annual revenue, 5,400+ users, 90% reduction in training time.

This is great credibility. But none of these are food distribution. None mention inventory. None mention supply chain. I see financial services, healthcare, automotive, education. Where's logistics? Where's manufacturing operations? Where's supply chain? I need to know they understand MY world, and I can't find that.

### The "Our Work" Page — Impressive Volume, Missing Relevance

I clicked to the Our Work page. The headline says: *"Whether you're looking to bring a new product to market, design a new app for your customers, or build technology to empower your internal teams, we're here to help."*

"Build technology to empower your internal teams" — YES. That's exactly what I need. An internal tool for my team to manage inventory. But it's buried in a list of other things.

There are dozens of case studies. Kawasaki, Bullhorn, MD Anderson, Whirlpool, financial services firms, healthcare, biotech, actuarial firms, wealth management, Harvard, dental solutions, truck business services, credit unions, real estate. The volume is impressive — these people have done a LOT of work. But there's a "Filter By Industries" dropdown and when I look at the industries listed, I don't see "Food & Beverage" or "Distribution" or "Logistics" or "Supply Chain." That worries me.

There are testimonials — one from Patrick West, Vice President of Apex Leaders: "I think everybody here has been really impressed and really happy with where the app is going. We trust that any crazy idea we cook up, you guys can really digest and say how it can be feasible, which is great." Good testimonial. But I want to hear from someone like ME — a CEO of a larger company in operations/logistics. I don't know who Apex Leaders is.

### The Industries Page — I'm Not Listed

I went to the Industries page. The industries they serve: Financial Services, Private Equity, Healthcare, Professional Services, Insurance, Technology, Legal, Knowledge/Education, Social Impact.

No food distribution. No logistics. No supply chain. No manufacturing. This is a problem. They say they're "industry-agnostic" and have "experience building hundreds of products across multiple industries," but if I don't see my industry listed, I feel like they might not understand my business. Why would I trust them with my problem if they've never worked in my space?

There's a section called "Problems We Solve" that's actually very relevant: "Manual Processes that Don't Scale" — that's EXACTLY my problem. "Backend Chaos, Frontend Friction" mentions "real-time inventory" — there it is! But I had to read deep into a table to find the word "inventory" once. One time on a page that should be telling me they can help me.

### The Contact Page — Clear and Simple

I clicked Contact. **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** — fine, not the most helpful headline but okay. There's a simple form: First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, and "How Can We Help You?" — that's straightforward. I can fill that out.

There's also a phone number: **(312) 888-9651**, and an email: **contact@launchpadlab.com**. Both clearly displayed. And LinkedIn. GOOD. Multiple ways to reach out. The phone number is important to me — I want to talk to a person, not just fill out a form and wonder if anyone reads it.

Below the form there are testimonials and Clutch badges. The "Proven Partner" section mentions "Diverse Skills & Services" and "Outcomes Driven" — the outcomes part is good. The Clutch badges give me some confidence — they've been rated by real clients.

But the page says *"Complete the form below to tell us about your project. We will get in touch with you as soon as possible."* "As soon as possible" — how soon? Today? Tomorrow? Next week? I'm losing money every day. I need to know that if I fill this out, someone will call me back within 24 hours, or even today. The vagueness here makes me nervous.

Also: there's NO mention of what happens after I submit the form. Do they schedule a call? Do they send me a questionnaire? Do they come to my office? I have NO idea what the next step looks like, and that makes me hesitate.

### The Services Page — Useful but Buried

The Services page has a section I liked: **"Discovery Space Navigator"** — "2 Sprints to Build a Prototype, 6 Weeks or Less to Launch, 5x Faster Time to Market." Wait — what's a "Sprint"? I keep seeing that word. But "6 Weeks or Less to Launch" — THAT'S what I want to hear. Six weeks! That's fast. But I had to dig through the Services page to find this. And "prototype" — does that mean a test version? I think so, but I'm not sure.

There's also a FAQ section. Questions like "How much does it cost to build a custom software solution?" and "How long does it take to build a digital product?" — these are exactly the questions I have. But they're collapsed, and I don't know if the answers will be in plain English or more jargon.

## Summary: Did I Achieve My Goals?

### Goal 1: Can LaunchPad Lab build custom software for a company like mine?
**Partially.** I can tell they build custom software — the case studies and client logos make that clear. They have 12+ years of experience and 730+ projects. But I never found a clear, simple statement like: "We build custom internal tools for businesses — inventory systems, operations platforms, workflow automation." The word "inventory" appeared ONCE on the entire site, buried in a table on the Industries page. Nothing on the homepage, nothing in the services descriptions, nothing in the case study titles.

### Goal 2: Find how to contact them and start a conversation.
**Yes.** The contact form is simple. There's a phone number and email. Multiple CTAs throughout the site point to the contact form. This part works well. But I don't know what happens after I reach out, which makes me hesitate.

### Would I Contact Them?
**Probably, yes — but reluctantly.** The client logos (Whirlpool, Harvard, Kawasaki) give me confidence. The numbers (12+ years, 730+ projects, 90% retention) are reassuring. The phone number means I can talk to a real person. But I'm not fully convinced they understand my specific problem. I would probably call them and say, "I need an inventory management system. Can you do that?" And I'd compare their answer with the other 4 tabs I have open.

### What Worked
- **Client logos** — Whirlpool, Harvard, Kawasaki, MD Anderson. These build instant credibility.
- **Stats** — 12+ years, 730+ projects, 240+ clients, 90% retention. Concrete and convincing.
- **Phone number** — (312) 888-9651. I can talk to a real person.
- **Contact form** — Simple, clear, not too many fields.
- **Testimonials** — Real quotes from real people.
- **Process section** — Discover/Deliver/Release gives me a rough idea of how it works.
- **Case study volume** — 40+ case studies show breadth of experience.

### What Didn't Work
- **AI-first messaging** — The whole site leads with AI when most businesses just need custom software. AI is not the #1 thing I'm looking for.
- **Pervasive jargon** — "Agile," "sprint," "MVP," "UAT," "Agentic AI," "cross-functional," "product discovery," "bespoke" — none of these mean anything to me.
- **No industry match** — Food distribution, logistics, supply chain — not listed anywhere in their Industries page.
- **Vague marketing copy** — "Bespoke, redefining experiences" and "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce" tell me nothing.
- **No clear "what happens next"** — After I submit the form, then what? How soon will someone respond?
- **No pricing guidance** — Not even a range. Not even "Projects typically start at $X." Nothing.
- **"Digital product" everywhere** — I don't know what a "digital product" is. Just call it "software" or "application" or "system."

### What Would Help Someone Like Me
1. **A headline that says what you do in plain English:** "We build custom software for businesses — inventory systems, operations tools, customer platforms."
2. **An industry page for logistics/distribution/manufacturing** — or at least mention these use cases.
3. **Jargon-free service descriptions** — Replace "Agile, cross-functional expertise" with "We work in small teams and show you progress every two weeks."
4. **A clear "What happens next" section** on the contact page — "Step 1: Fill out the form. Step 2: We'll call you within 24 hours. Step 3: We'll have a 30-minute call to understand your needs."
5. **Pricing guidance** — Even "Projects typically range from $50K to $500K depending on complexity" would help me understand if this is in my budget.
6. **A case study involving operations or inventory** — Even one would make me feel like they understand my world.
