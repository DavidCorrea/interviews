## First Impressions

I typed in launchpadlab.com and the page loaded quickly. The first thing I saw was a bold headline: "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." Directly underneath, there was a brief paragraph explaining that LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness AI through consulting and product development — modernizing operations, reducing costs, unlocking growth. That got my attention. It was direct and relevant.

There was a button that said "Connect with an Expert," which I appreciated. Clear call to action, no guessing.

Below the hero section, I saw a strip that said "Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses" followed by client logos — Kawasaki, 1-800-GOT-JUNK, Harvard, Prosci, Whirlpool, Northwestern, CDK Global, Lurie Children's Hospital, Indiana University, Select Home Warranty, MD Anderson, Bullhorn. That is an impressive client list. It gave me some confidence right away. These are real, recognizable names.

I scrolled down and found a section called "Your Strategic AI Partner" with a subheading about "AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise." The copy explained they combine product design and development with AI consulting and have helped hundreds of businesses. The language was professional enough, though phrases like "cutting-edge AI consulting" made me pause. Everyone says they are cutting-edge. I wanted specifics.

## Exploring the Services

The homepage listed six services in a card layout:

1. **AI Automation & Agentic AI** — "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce"
2. **Web Application Development** — "Bespoke, redefining experiences"
3. **Mobile Application Development** — "Meeting users where they are"
4. **Salesforce Development** — "Solving business problems"
5. **Product Strategy & Design** — "Agile, cross-functional expertise"
6. **Managed Services & Support** — "Operating as an extension of your team"

The first one — AI Automation — is exactly what I was looking for. "Agentic AI" is a term I have heard tossed around at conferences but I am not entirely sure what it means in practice. "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce" — that is a big claim. I wanted to learn more.

Below the services, there was a tabbed section labeled "Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast." The tabs were Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement, Scalable Solutions, Expansive Resources, and Speed to Market. Operational Efficiency was already selected. The copy said "Streamline processes with digital products to enhance productivity." It was generic. I would have liked specific examples. I did not click the other tabs — I was more interested in the AI services at this point.

I saw some statistics: 12+ years in business, 730+ projects, 240+ clients. The note that "90% work with us for longer than one year" was reassuring. That suggests clients are satisfied enough to stay.

There was also a "Put AI to Work" section that said: "The companies pulling ahead are using AI to automate repetitive work, improve decision-making, and deliver experiences their competitors can't match." Good — that resonated with my situation. But "Game-Changing Digital Products" and "Ship to Market Fast" — that language feels aimed at startups, not a VP of Operations at a logistics company trying to figure out how AI fits into our existing processes.

## Navigating the Site — Where Things Got Confusing

This is where my experience got frustrating.

I wanted to click on "Services" in the top navigation to see an overview of what they offer. When I clicked it, a dropdown menu appeared with all the sub-services listed — AI Automation, Web App Development, Mobile App Development, Salesforce Development, Product Strategy & Design, and Managed Services & Support. But at the same time, the page behind the dropdown changed. It was now showing content about Mobile Application Development, not a Services overview page. I never clicked on Mobile App Development. I clicked "Services."

I tried clicking "AI Automation" from the dropdown that had appeared, but the page did not change. I was still looking at Mobile Application Development content. This was disorienting. I am someone who clicks methodically. I clicked a link. Nothing happened. That shakes my confidence.

I then clicked "Services" again, thinking it would take me to a services overview. Instead, I ended up on a completely different page — the "Our Work & Case Studies" page. I had not clicked "Our Work." I clicked "Services." Twice. And I ended up on two completely unrelated pages, neither of which was a services overview.

This was genuinely confusing. I am not a technical person. When I click a menu item labeled "Services," I expect to see a page about services. Not a random sub-page, and not a case studies page. If I were evaluating this company as a vendor and this was my first interaction, I would question whether their own website is working correctly.

I eventually navigated back to the homepage by clicking the LaunchPad Lab logo — that, at least, worked reliably — and found the "AI Automation & Agentic AI" card link directly on the homepage. I clicked it from there and finally reached the page I wanted.

## The AI Automation Page

The headline was "Transform Business Operations with AI Automation and Agentic AI." Good. Below that: "AI automation and an agentic workforce remove bottlenecks with speed and scale. Businesses are seeing significant returns with increased operational efficiency, improved customer satisfaction, and enhanced decision-making capabilities." That is exactly the pitch I needed to hear, though I still do not know what "agentic workforce" means in plain terms.

The call to action was "Book an AI Automation Assessment," which linked to an AI workshop page. That is a clear next step. I liked that.

The page listed five capabilities:

1. **Autonomous Automation** — AI automates repetitive, rules-based tasks like intake, triage, documentation
2. **Agentic AI Deployment** — Train digital agents to act independently
3. **Integrated Data Workflows** — Connect systems for clean, actionable data
4. **Business Logic Codification** — Convert human knowledge into repeatable workflows
5. **Rapid AI Rollouts** — Concept to launch in 6 weeks

That is helpful. "Business Logic Codification" actually sounded relevant to us — we have a lot of institutional knowledge in our dispatch and routing teams that lives in people's heads. If they can systematize that, I would want to hear how.

There was a section about the "Agentforce Quick Start Program" — go live in 6 weeks. It mentioned building a "customer-facing Agentforce." Here is where I started feeling a concern: this seems very Salesforce-specific. "Agentforce" is a Salesforce product. We do not use Salesforce. I would need to know whether their AI services work outside the Salesforce ecosystem, and the page did not make that clear.

A problems-solved table showed pain points mapped to solutions:
- Slow, Manual Processes → Intelligent automation
- Siloed, Disconnected Systems → Integrated AI pulling real-time data
- Inconsistent Execution → Always-on rules-driven agents
- Limited Team Capacity → Autonomous agents scaling without headcount
- Low Data Visibility → Structured data pipelines for real-time decisions

These all apply to my business. Every single one of them. But I notice the solutions are described in very general terms. There are no concrete examples specific to an operations or logistics context.

Statistics: 60%+ reduction in repetitive manual work, 3x faster response across service channels, 6 weeks to deploy. Bold claims. I would want to validate these.

The process section was helpful: AI Opportunity Workshop (Free) → Proof of Concept (3-4 weeks) → Production Deployment (2-3 months) → Ongoing Optimization. The fact that the initial workshop is free is a smart move. That would lower the barrier for me to engage.

## Case Studies

There were three case studies featured on the AI page: Bullhorn, Kawasaki, and Prosci. I clicked the Bullhorn one.

The Bullhorn case study was impressively detailed. It covered the challenge (legacy systems from acquisitions, outdated UX, manual support workflows), the approach (research, planning, technical requirements, tech stack decisions), the solution (SSO, personalization, modernized workflows, Agentforce support), and results (improved adoption, speed to market, cost savings, retention).

This is exactly the kind of content I want to see from a vendor. Real client, real problem, detailed approach, measurable results. If they had a case study like this for a logistics or supply chain company, I would be close to picking up the phone.

But they do not. Not one of their case studies was from logistics, supply chain, transportation, or manufacturing. The case study carousel on the homepage featured Millennium Trust Company (financial services), Prosci (change management), and CDK Global (automotive software). The full case studies page listed dozens of projects — financial services, healthcare, technology, education, real estate, staffing — but no logistics.

## Finding My Industry

I checked the Industries section. Clicking "Industries" in the navigation opened a dropdown showing: Financial Services, Healthcare, Professional Services, Insurance, Technology, Legal, Private Equity, Education, Social Impact.

No logistics. No supply chain. No manufacturing. No transportation.

The Industries page itself mentioned being "industry-agnostic" and the hero text even named "manufacturing" in passing, but there was no dedicated page for it. The industries listed were all professional services and white-collar sectors.

The page said: "With experience building hundreds of products across multiple industries, we ramp up quickly and deliver solutions tailored to your business. As an industry-agnostic agency, we challenge assumptions and push teams to think beyond the status quo."

That is a fair claim, but if you are industry-agnostic, why are only nine very specific industries listed? Where is operations? Where is logistics? My board asked me to find AI solutions for a 400-person logistics company. If a vendor's website has no evidence they understand my world — my warehouses, my trucks, my routing problems, my compliance requirements — I have to wonder if they are the right fit.

## Finding Contact Information

This was another frustration. I clicked "Contact" in the top navigation, and the page that loaded was the homepage. Not a contact page. The homepage. It might have been trying to scroll me down to the contact form at the bottom of the homepage, but since I navigated from a different page, I just saw the top of the homepage again.

There is no dedicated contact page. The phone number — (312) 888-9651 — is buried in the footer. I found it, but I had to scroll past everything to get there. The address is also in the footer: 2045 W Grand Ave Ste B PMB 37406, Chicago, Illinois 60612.

There is no email address listed anywhere on the site. Not a general info@ address, not a sales address, not individual emails for the leadership team. The only way to reach them is to fill out a form or call the number in the footer. As someone who researches vendors carefully before making a call, I would have liked the option to send an email first — something brief, professional, with a specific question attached. Forms feel like they go into a black hole.

The form itself requires: First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, and "How Can We Help You?" — all marked as required. There is also what appears to be a CAPTCHA (an iframe). Every single page has this same form at the bottom. I saw it on the homepage, the AI Automation page, the Bullhorn case study, the About page, the Industries page. It is the same form, repeated everywhere. That struck me as unusual. Is there truly no other way to reach a human being?

## The About Page

I visited the About page. "Our Award-Winning Digital Product Firm" — since 2012, 240+ companies. They listed their leadership team: 15 people with names, titles, and LinkedIn links. The CEO is Scott Weisman. The President and Head of Sales is Ryan Francis. They have a CTO, VP of Design, VPs, engineering managers, product managers.

I noticed the statistics here said "13+ Years in Business" while the homepage said "12+ Years in Business." A small inconsistency, but when I am evaluating a company's attention to detail, things like that register.

No one on the leadership team has an operations or supply chain background based on titles alone. That is not necessarily a disqualifier — they are a tech company — but it contributes to my sense that logistics is not their strong suit.

## Accessibility and Readability Observations

Throughout my visit, I noticed several things that made the experience less than smooth:

**The navigation was unpredictable.** Clicking "Services" and "Industries" sometimes opened dropdowns, sometimes navigated to unexpected pages, and sometimes seemed to do nothing. This is the most basic interaction on a website — clicking a menu — and it was unreliable.

**The "Contact" link does not go to a contact page.** It either loads the homepage or scrolls to a form. There should be a dedicated contact page with phone, email, address, and maybe a map.

**There is no email address.** A business like mine expects to be able to email a vendor directly. Forcing everyone through a form is a barrier.

**The carousel counter was confusing.** On the case studies section, I saw text that read "slide 5 to 7 of 3." That does not make sense. Five to seven of three? This seems like a technical glitch, and it is the kind of thing that makes a detail-oriented person like me question overall quality.

**Repetitive contact forms.** Every single page ends with the same form. It felt like being asked "Can I help you?" at a store seven times while you are still browsing. Once or twice is fine. On every page is excessive.

**Language was often buzzword-heavy.** "Game-Changing Digital Products," "autonomous digital workforce," "ship to market fast," "bespoke, redefining experiences." As someone evaluating a vendor for a multi-hundred-thousand-dollar engagement, I want substance, not slogans. Some sections did this well — the Bullhorn case study, the AI Automation problems table. Others did not.

**Inconsistent data.** The homepage says "12+ Years in Business." The About page says "13+." Which is it?

**Empty visual elements.** In the client logos section and the Clutch badges section, several items appeared to be missing images or had empty content. If these are supposed to be awards or logos, some were not showing up.

**The FAQ sections are closed by default.** On the AI Automation page and Industries page, there were FAQ sections. They appeared as collapsed groups. I did not try expanding them — I was focused on finding AI services and contact information — but they would be easy to miss if you are scanning quickly.

**Heavy Salesforce emphasis.** The AI services page leaned very heavily on Salesforce and Agentforce. For a company that does not use Salesforce, this raises the question: will they even be able to help me? The page did not clearly separate Salesforce-specific offerings from platform-agnostic AI capabilities.

## My Overall Verdict

LaunchPad Lab is clearly a competent digital product firm. They have impressive clients — Harvard, Whirlpool, MD Anderson, Bullhorn. They have been around for over a decade. The Bullhorn case study was the single most convincing piece of content on the site — detailed, credible, results-oriented.

Their AI offerings are real and seem substantive. The free AI Opportunity Workshop is a smart entry point. The six-week deployment timeline is attractive. The problems they describe — manual processes, siloed systems, limited team capacity — are exactly my problems.

**However**, there are several things that would give me pause before picking up the phone:

1. **No evidence they understand logistics or operations.** Not one case study, not one industry page, not one mention of supply chain, warehouse operations, fleet management, routing optimization, or anything adjacent to my business. Their client list is dominated by financial services, healthcare, and tech companies.

2. **The Salesforce dependency is unclear.** If their AI work requires Salesforce, that is a major additional cost and implementation effort for us. The website does not clarify whether their services work outside the Salesforce ecosystem.

3. **The website navigation is broken.** I could not reliably navigate to the pages I wanted. For a company that builds digital products for a living, having a website where the navigation does not work correctly is a red flag.

4. **No easy way to send an email.** I do not want to fill out a form as my first point of contact. I want to send a professional email with specific questions.

5. **The language trends toward hype.** "Game-changing," "autonomous workforce," "ship fast" — this is conference-talk, not boardroom-talk. The Bullhorn case study proved they can be specific and credible. The rest of the site should follow that example.

Would I reach out? Maybe. I would probably discuss it with my team first. The free workshop is appealing, and the phone number is available even if it took some scrolling to find. But if a competitor's website clearly showed experience with logistics companies and had a visible email address, they would get my call first.

**Bottom line:** Strong credentials, weak discoverability for someone in my position. The site seems built for people who already know what they want and are ready to fill out a form. It is not built for someone like me — methodical, skeptical, trying to figure out if this company understands my world before I commit to a conversation.
