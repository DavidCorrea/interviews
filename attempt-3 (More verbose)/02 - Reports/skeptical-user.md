# Credibility & Trust Technical Report: Skeptical User (Credibility Evaluator)

**Persona:** Jordan Reeves (Director of Product, B2B SaaS)  
**Website:** https://launchpadlab.com/  
**Date:** February 16, 2025  
**Testing Focus:** Credibility assessment—evidence, transparency, verifiability, and trust signals for skeptical evaluators.

---

## Executive Summary

LaunchPad Lab's website presents a professional front and completes the core task (find what they do and how to contact them). However, credibility gaps undermine trust for skeptical evaluators: unverifiable statistics, award badges without context, predominantly generic testimonials, case studies lacking measurable outcomes, no process or pricing transparency, and a contact path that feels like lead capture. The site provides structure but insufficient substance. Recommendations focus on adding evidence, transparency, and measurable outcomes to build trust.

## Credibility Issues Identified

### 1. Unverifiable Statistics

| Attribute | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Finding** | Statistics ("12+ Years in Business," "730+ Projects," "4.8 Rating") are presented without source, methodology, or verification path. |
| **Impact** | Skeptical users cannot verify claims. "4.8 rating" could mean 5 reviews or 500; "730+ projects" could include minor engagements. Without context, numbers feel inflated or meaningless. |
| **Trust Gap** | High. Statistics presented as proof without evidence undermine rather than support credibility. |

**Recommendation:** Add source attribution for all statistics. Example: "4.8/5 from 47 verified reviews on Clutch" with link to Clutch profile. For project count: "730+ projects delivered since 2012" or link to methodology. Make verification one-click.

---

### 2. Award Badges Without Context

| Attribute | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Finding** | Seven or more award badges (Clutch, Inc. 5000, others) displayed with no tooltips, links, or explanations. User cannot determine: who awarded, what criteria, when, or how to verify. |
| **Impact** | Badges read as decoration, not evidence. "Top Agency 2024" is meaningless without context. Skeptical users dismiss unexplained awards as vanity. |
| **Trust Gap** | High. Awards could be meaningful; without context they add no credibility. |

**Recommendation:** Add tooltips or an "Awards" page explaining each badge: "Clutch Top B2B Services Firm 2024—based on verified client reviews and market presence." Link to Clutch, Inc. 5000 listing, etc. Transform decoration into verifiable evidence.

---

### 3. Generic Testimonials

| Attribute | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Finding** | Five testimonials on Contact page; four are generic ("fun to work with," "exceeded expectations," "really impressed"). One includes measurable outcome (7% increase in membership sales) but lacks attribution. No client names, roles, or project context for most quotes. |
| **Impact** | Generic testimonials could apply to any agency. Skeptical users discount them. The one substantive quote is weakened by lack of attribution—cannot verify or look up. |
| **Trust Gap** | High. Testimonials are primary trust signal; generic quotes do not build confidence. |

**Recommendation:** Prioritize substantive testimonials with: (1) measurable outcomes, (2) client name and role (with permission), (3) project type. Example: "Sarah Chen, VP of Product at Amplify Credit Union: 'The first full year our system was in place, we saw a 7% increase in both online membership sales and general admission tickets.'" Reduce or relocate generic quotes.

---

### 4. Case Studies Lack Measurable Outcomes

| Attribute | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Finding** | Case studies (Chicago Line Cruises, Amplify Credit Union, Apex Leaders) describe what was built—technologies, features, challenges—but omit measurable outcomes. No before/after metrics, conversion rates, performance improvements, or business impact. |
| **Impact** | Case studies read as marketing, not proof. "We built a modern ticketing site" does not demonstrate success. Skeptical users want "We reduced checkout abandonment by 23%" or "Page load time improved 40%." |
| **Trust Gap** | High. Case studies are key verification path; without outcomes they fail to build trust. |

**Recommendation:** Add measurable outcomes to each case study. Work with clients for permission to publish: conversion increases, performance metrics, support ticket reduction, adoption rates. If data unavailable, state "Results pending client approval" or focus on qualitative outcomes with specificity. Replace vague language ("streamlined operations") with concrete descriptions.

---

### 5. No Process or Pricing Transparency

| Attribute | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Finding** | No "How we work" or "Our process" section. No indication of typical engagement size, timeline, or pricing range. No explanation of what happens after "Contact Us." |
| **Impact** | "Contact Us" as sole path feels like black box. Skeptical users want to understand process before committing. Lack of transparency triggers suspicion—what are they hiding? |
| **Trust Gap** | High. Process transparency is baseline expectation for B2B evaluators. |

**Recommendation:** Add "How we work" section: discovery call → proposal → kickoff → delivery phases. Include typical timelines ("Discovery: 2 weeks"; "Full engagement: 3–6 months"). For pricing: "Typical engagements range from $X–$Y" or "We provide custom proposals after discovery." Set expectations. Add "What to expect" on Contact page: "We respond within 24 hours" and "Next step: 30-minute discovery call."

---

### 6. Contact Path Lacks Expectation Setting

| Attribute | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Finding** | Contact page places testimonials above form. No phone, email, or response-time commitment. No explanation of next steps. Form feels like lead capture with no commitment to user. |
| **Impact** | User submits form without knowing: Will they respond? How soon? What do they need? What's the next step? Reduces conversion and trust. |
| **Trust Gap** | Medium–High. Contact should feel like clear path, not trap. |

**Recommendation:** Move contact form above testimonials, or add "Skip to contact form" link. Add copy: "We respond within 24 hours. Next step: 30-minute discovery call to discuss your project." Include phone and email for users who prefer direct contact. Specify what to include: "Project type, timeline, and budget range help us prepare."

---

### 7. Buzzwords Without Concrete Examples

| Attribute | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Finding** | "AI-centric," "digital transformation," "innovation" used without concrete examples. Hero and Services copy rely on industry buzzwords. User cannot distinguish LaunchPad Lab from generic "digital agency" language. |
| **Impact** | Buzzwords without substance feel empty. Skeptical users dismiss them. What does "AI-centric" mean in practice? Custom models? API integration? UX design for AI products? |
| **Trust Gap** | Medium. Differentiators are unclear; firm blends into generic agency landscape. |

**Recommendation:** Replace buzzwords with specifics. "AI-centric" → "We build custom AI integrations, design AI-powered UX, and implement LLM-based features." Add concrete examples: "Recent project: RAG-powered search for financial documents." Case studies should demonstrate AI work explicitly where applicable.

## Recommendations: Adding Evidence, Transparency, and Measurable Outcomes

### Evidence

1. **Statistics:** Link every statistic to a verifiable source. Clutch profile for rating. Methodology page for project count.
2. **Awards:** Create Awards page or tooltips explaining each badge. Link to awarding body.
3. **Testimonials:** Add client name, role, company (with permission). Prioritize quotes with measurable outcomes.
4. **Case studies:** Add before/after metrics, conversion rates, performance improvements. Work with clients for approval.

### Transparency

1. **Process:** Publish "How we work" with phases, deliverables, and typical timelines.
2. **Pricing:** Provide range or "custom proposal after discovery"—avoid complete opacity.
3. **Contact:** Explain response time, next steps, and what information to include.

### Measurable Outcomes

1. **Case studies:** Every case study should include at least one quantified outcome (%, $, time, adoption).
2. **Testimonials:** Prioritize quotes that mention specific deliverables, processes, or results.
3. **Homepage:** Consider adding "Proven results" section with 2–3 headline metrics from case studies.

## Verification Paths

| Claim | Current State | Recommended |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 4.8 rating | No source | Link to Clutch |
| 730+ projects | No methodology | Methodology page or footnote |
| Client logos | No project context | Link case studies to logos |
| Awards | No context | Tooltips, Awards page, links |
| Testimonials | Largely unattributed | Name, role, company |
| Case studies | No outcomes | Add metrics |

## Conclusion

LaunchPad Lab's site completes the core task but fails to build trust for skeptical evaluators. The primary gaps are evidence (unverifiable statistics, context-free badges, generic testimonials, outcome-free case studies) and transparency (no process, no pricing, no contact expectations). Implementing the recommendations above would transform the site from marketing brochure to credibility-building resource. For users who have been burned by vendors, evidence and transparency are non-negotiable.
