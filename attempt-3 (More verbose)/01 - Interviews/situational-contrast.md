## First-Person Narrative

I'm Jordan. I'm a product manager at a fintech startup in Chicago. I have 20/20 vision. No corrective lenses. I work from cafés, co-working spaces, sometimes the park when it's nice. Today I'm at an outdoor table on a sunny afternoon. Laptop open. Screen brightness cranked to 100%. I've heard LaunchPad Lab is an AI-centric digital product design and development firm—exactly what I need for a project I'm evaluating. I want to find what they do and how to contact them. Simple. I'll tell you what happened.

**The hero section hit me like a wall of light.** The headline—"AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development"—I could make it out. Large. Dark enough. But the subtext underneath? Gone. Washed out. Completely invisible. I know the site uses light gray text. #666, #777, somewhere in that range. Indoors, in a dark room, it might pass. Out here? The sun is reflecting off my screen. The white background is a bright field. The gray text has no contrast left. It's not there. I tilted the screen. I cupped my hand over the display to create shade. I could barely parse a few words. "Harness" something. "Power" something. I gave up. I moved on. I still didn't know clearly what they do.

**I looked for the navigation.** Work. Services. About. Connect with an Expert. Were those links? I couldn't tell. There were no underlines. No bold. Just text. Same washed-out gray as everything else. In glare, color-only differentiation fails. If the only cue that something is a link is a slightly different shade of gray or a blue tint, I cannot see it. The glare flattens everything. I hovered. Did an underline appear? I'm not sure. I tabbed through. Did a focus ring appear? I couldn't see one. Faint focus indicators—1px light gray outline, subtle border—disappear in sunlight. I had no idea where I was. I guessed "Connect with an Expert" was the contact path. I hoped I was right. I clicked.

**The six service boxes were a test of endurance.** I scrolled. Each box had a heading and a description. The headings—slightly bolder, slightly darker—I could read those. "Discovery & Strategy." "UX Research." "Design." "Development." The descriptions underneath? Paragraphs of light gray on white. In the glare, they vanished. I squinted. I tilted the screen again. I cupped my hand over the display. I could extract a word here, a phrase there. "Bespoke." "Agentic." "Cross-functional." I got fragments. I did not get the full picture. What others read effortlessly indoors required sustained physical effort from me. My neck hurt from tilting. My hand cramped from cupping. After two minutes, I felt the familiar fatigue. The desire to close the tab. To find shade. To come back later. I pushed through because I was evaluating. A real visitor might have left.

**The body text was invisible.** Every paragraph. Every block of copy. The testimonials—long quote blocks in italic, light gray—were the worst. Italic distorts letter shapes. Light gray in glare is gone. I scrolled past them. I didn't try to read. I knew I couldn't. The case study descriptions. The service copy. The "Learn more" links—were they even links? I couldn't see them. No underlines. No bold. If they're differentiated only by color, they're invisible to me in this light. I may have scrolled past half the interactive elements on the page without knowing they were there.

**I tabbed through the page.** Keyboard navigation. I wanted to find the form, the links, the buttons. At each element, I paused. Where am I? Is there a focus ring? I couldn't see one. Faint focus indicators—thin outlines, light gray borders—vanish in glare. I tabbed blindly. I hoped I was landing on something useful. Form fields. Buttons. Links. I had no visual confirmation. I was guessing. That's not navigation. That's hope.

**The statistics section was a relief.** "12+ Years." "730+ Projects." "4.8" rating. Numbers. Short labels. If those had been in light gray too, they would have been useless. But they stood out. Bold. Darker. I could read them. That's what works in sunlight. High-contrast elements. Bold text. Clear borders. More of that, please.

**The "Connect with an Expert" CTA.** I found it. I clicked it. But did it stand out? Would I have noticed it if I hadn't been hunting? Low-contrast buttons—light gray on white, pale blue on white—do not register in glare. They look like empty space. Decorative. I need strong borders. Bold text. High-contrast backgrounds. This CTA—I'm not sure it had enough. I got there. But it wasn't obvious.

**The contact page: testimonials first, form second.** I landed on the Contact page. Five testimonial blocks. Long. Italic. Light gray. In the sun, they were a bright blur. I scrolled. I scrolled. I needed the form. Finally I saw it. Labels. Fields. Submit button. Were the labels dark? Or light gray? I cupped my hand again. I tilted. I think they were readable. Barely. Placeholder text in light gray would have been invisible. I didn't trust what I was seeing. The submit button—did it stand out? Could I see the focus ring when I tabbed to it? I wasn't confident. I filled out what I could. I hoped I didn't miss a field.

**I know what they do.** I pieced it together from the headings. AI-centric digital product design and development. Discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, support. The information was there. I got it from the high-contrast elements—the headings, the statistics, the structure. The body text? I skipped it. I couldn't read it. Not in this light.

**What it cost me.** Physical strain. Tilting. Cupping. Squinting. Fatigue. Uncertainty. Every paragraph of light gray was a wall. Every link without an underline was a guess. Every faint focus indicator was gone. I have maxed my screen brightness. There is no more to give. The site must work in my environment. It didn't. I would not have persisted if I hadn't been doing this evaluation. A real visitor—someone like me, at a café, in the park, on a train by the window—might have closed the tab after thirty seconds. "I'll look at this later." And maybe they wouldn't.

**Rating: 1.5 out of 5.** I completed the task. I found what they do and how to contact them. But the experience was punishing. The body text in #666–#777 on white—the exact range that washes out in sunlight—was everywhere. Links were indistinguishable. Focus indicators were invisible. I had to cup my hand over the screen. I had to tilt. I had to guess. A 2 would mean it was barely tolerable. A 1 would mean I gave up. I'm at 1.5. I got there. But I felt forgotten. I felt like the site was built for a dark room. I'm in the real world. Bright light. Glare. Max brightness. The site did not adapt. For a digital product design and development firm—especially one that works with AI and user experience—that's a gap. Fix the contrast. Add underlines to links. Make focus indicators visible. Design for sunlight. It's not a niche case. It's where people actually use laptops.

## Additional Reflections

**On the light gray:** #666, #777 on white. Designers use it everywhere. Indoors, it might pass WCAG. Outdoors, in glare, it fails completely. The effective contrast collapses. What appears as 4.5:1 in a dark room can drop to 2:1 or worse in sunlight. Glare reduces the perceived contrast of your entire screen. I shouldn't have to cup my hand. I shouldn't have to tilt. The site should work at max brightness in bright light. Darker text. #595959 minimum. #404040 for AAA. That would transform my experience.

**On links:** If links are differentiated only by color, they are invisible in glare. I cannot find them. I hover randomly. I tab blindly. I miss links entirely. Underlines. Bold. Icons. Something that isn't color. Every link needs a non-color cue. It's WCAG 1.4.1. It's basic. And in sunlight, it's essential.

**On focus indicators:** I tab through the page. Where am I? I need to know. Faint focus rings—1px light gray outline—disappear in glare. I need high-contrast focus states. Thick borders. Dark outlines. Visible. Obvious. Without them, keyboard navigation in sunlight is guesswork. I documented every focus state that would vanish. They all would.

**On cupping and tilting:** I did both. Repeatedly. Cupping my hand over the display to create shade. Tilting the screen to reduce reflection. These are temporary fixes. They're exhausting. The site should not require them. When a design firm's own site forces me to physically manipulate my environment to read their content, they've failed. I'm not asking for perfection. I'm asking for text I can read in the conditions where I actually browse.

**On who this affects:** I have normal vision. 20/20. No corrective lenses. This isn't a vision impairment. It's an environmental constraint. Outdoor cafés. Bright offices with floor-to-ceiling windows. Train seats facing the sun. Anyone browsing in uncontrolled lighting experiences this. The site uses a palette that fails in real-world conditions. That's a design choice. It's the wrong one.

**On what would have helped:** Dark text. Underlined links. Visible focus indicators. Heavier font weight. High-contrast buttons. Bold labels. Content that "pops" against glare instead of dissolving into it. That's it. Those changes would have made the site usable in sunlight. Instead, I struggled. I strained. I got there. Barely.

**On whether I'd contact them:** I found the form. I know what they do. I could fill it out. But I'd go in with a question: If their own site doesn't work in sunlight, do they consider real-world conditions when they build for clients? I'll ask. I hope this feedback helps.

**On the award badges:** Seven or more. If there was text on or near them—captions, labels—I didn't read it. Secondary content in light gray is the lowest contrast on the page. In glare, it's gone. I skip it. I've learned to. "Powered by" text, footnotes, captions—they're usually invisible. I flag them all.

**On the footer:** I looked for phone and email. Alternative contact methods matter. Were they in the footer? In light gray? I didn't find them easily. Footer links and contact details often use the lowest contrast. In sunlight, they might as well not exist.

**On the case studies:** I glanced at the Work section. Project cards, descriptions. The descriptions—more light gray paragraphs. I didn't dive deep. I knew what I'd find. Same barriers. Same strain. I got the gist from headings. The written copy? I'd need to cup my hand again. I didn't have the energy.

**On comparison to other agencies:** I've looked at other digital product firms. Some are worse. LaunchPad Lab isn't the worst. But it's not good. The bar for "acceptable" for me in sunlight: can I read the key information without cupping my hand? Can I find the contact path without guessing? Can I see where I am when I tab? I did it, but barely. A site that gets it right would feel effortless. I'd leave thinking, "That worked." I didn't. I left thinking, "I need to find shade."

**On what "included" feels like:** When a site works in sunlight, I feel respected. I can read without tilting. I can find links without guessing. I can tab and see where I am. LaunchPad Lab didn't give me that. I felt forgotten. I felt like the site was built for someone else's environment. For a firm that builds digital products, that's a missed opportunity.

**On recommending the site:** Would I tell a colleague to use this site outdoors? I'd say: "Find shade first. Or wait until you're indoors. The body text disappears in sunlight. The links don't have underlines. You'll be cupping your hand over the screen. Good luck." That's not a recommendation. A site that works in real-world conditions wouldn't need that warning.

**On browser zoom:** I sometimes zoom to 125% when sites are hard to read. It helps a little. Bigger text is easier. But zoom doesn't fix contrast. Light gray stays light gray. The glare still washes it out. And does the layout break? Overlapping text, cut-off content—that would make things worse. Zoom is a workaround, not a solution. The site should work at 100% in sunlight.

**On True Tone and Night Shift:** I've tried both. Neither helps with outdoor glare. True Tone adjusts color temperature. Night Shift reduces blue light. Neither increases contrast. Neither makes light gray text readable in sunlight. The site must provide sufficient contrast on its own.

**Final thoughts:** I completed the task. I found what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them. But the journey was punishing. Every typographic choice—the light gray, the links without underlines, the faint focus indicators—made it harder. I'm not in a dark room. I'm at a café. In the sun. Screen brightness maxed. The site did not meet me where I am. For a firm that builds digital products, that's a missed opportunity. Design for the real world. Not just the ideal one.

*Note: This interview was conducted by embodying the situational contrast persona (Jordan Chen) as defined in the persona document. All observations reflect the simulated experience of a user with normal vision browsing launchpadlab.com outdoors in bright sunlight, with screen brightness maxed. Body text (#666–#777) on white washes out; links without underlines are indistinguishable; faint focus indicators disappear; headings remain readable but body text is lost. The user resorted to cupping hands over the screen and tilting the display to reduce glare.*
