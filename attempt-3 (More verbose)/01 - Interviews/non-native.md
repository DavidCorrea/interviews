## First-Person Narrative

I am Priya. I am a product manager in Mumbai. I use English every day for work—emails, calls, documents. I can read and write. But I am not a native speaker. When I see words like "bespoke" or "agentic," I have to stop. I have to think. Sometimes I look them up. When I see phrases like "harness the power" or "move the needle," I do not know what they mean. I read them literally and they make no sense. I came to this website to find out what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them. I will tell you what happened.

**The hero section confused me immediately.** The headline said "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." I know "AI" means artificial intelligence. I know "digital" and "product" and "design" and "development." But "AI-centric"? What does that mean? Is it the same as "AI-focused"? Is it different? I had to guess. I thought maybe it means they focus on AI. But why not say "We focus on AI" or "We build AI products"? The word "centric" is not common for me. I had to read it twice. Below the headline there was more text. I think it said something about "harnessing the power" of something. "Harness the power"—I do not understand this. Harness is for horses. How do you harness power? I tried Google Translate in my head. It did not help. I skipped that sentence. I moved on. I still did not know clearly what they do. Do they build websites? Apps? Both? Something else? I was not sure.

**The navigation was okay but one label bothered me.** I saw Work, Services, About, and "Connect with an Expert." Work and Services and About—I understand those. But "Connect with an Expert"? Is that the contact button? I am used to looking for "Contact" or "Contact Us." Every website I know has a Contact link. Here I had to guess. Connect with an expert—connect with whom? An expert from their company? Is that how I contact them? I think yes. But I was not certain. I had to click to find out. I prefer when the label says exactly what will happen. "Contact" says it. "Connect with an Expert" does not.

**The six service boxes were the hardest part.** I read each one slowly. The first said something about "AI Automation" and "Agentic AI." Agentic—I have never seen this word. I looked at the context. It did not help. Is it like "automatic"? Or "intelligent"? I did not know. I moved to the next box. "Bespoke"—I have heard this word before. I think it means custom or made for you. But I am not sure. Why not say "custom" or "tailored"? "Bespoke" sounds like marketing. It does not help me understand. Another box said "cross-functional" and "discovery process." Cross-functional—does that mean different teams work together? I think so. But I had to guess. Discovery process—what do they discover? Ideas? Problems? Requirements? The words are vague. I read "seamless handoff" somewhere. Handoff—like in sports? I know handoff from cricket. But "seamless handoff" in business? I do not understand. One service mentioned "proof of concept." I know "proof" and "concept" separately. Together? I think it means a small test or demo. But it was not explained. I had to infer. By the time I finished all six boxes, I was tired. I could not hold all the information. I knew they do something with AI, websites, apps, and strategy. But I could not explain it simply to someone else. I wished there was one sentence at the top: "We build websites and mobile apps for businesses. We also help with AI." That would have saved me a lot of work.

**I saw acronyms that were not explained.** ROI, MVP, UAT, UX—these appeared in the text. I know "AI" and "UX" from my job. UX is user experience. But ROI? I think it is Return on Investment. I am not sure. MVP? I think Minimum Viable Product. UAT? I do not know. I had to look it up. When acronyms are not spelled out on first use, I lose time. I expect "ROI (Return on Investment)" or "MVP (Minimum Viable Product)" so I can learn and then recognize them later. The site did not do that. I had to guess or search. That is frustrating.

**The testimonials made things worse.** I scrolled down and saw long quotes from clients. One said: "Their attention to detail in the discovery process, and their selective choice of questioning is what really stood out to me." I read it three times. "Selective choice of questioning"—what does that mean? Do they ask good questions? Do they choose which questions to ask? I could not picture it. Another testimonial said: "through what could otherwise become a tumultuous journey of entrepreneurship." Tumultuous journey—is that an idiom? I know "tumultuous" means chaotic or difficult. But "journey of entrepreneurship"? The sentence was long. Too many ideas. I lost the thread. One testimonial was clearer: "we saw a 7% increase in both online membership sales and general admission tickets." Numbers. Concrete. I understood that. They built something that helped with sales. That helped. But most of the testimonials used the same jargon as the main copy. They did not clarify anything. They repeated words I already did not understand. I skipped most of them.

**The statistics and badges were fine.** "12+ years," "730+ projects," "4.8 rating"—numbers and short labels. I could process those quickly. No jargon. No idioms. That was a relief.

**Finding the contact form took effort.** I clicked "Connect with an Expert" and landed on the Contact page. But the first thing I saw was more testimonials. Five long quote blocks, one after another. I had to scroll past all of them to reach the form. Why are testimonials above the form? I came to contact them. I did not come to read five more quotes. I scrolled. I scrolled. Finally I saw the form. The labels were okay—Name, Email, Company, Message. I could understand those. But one field had a dropdown. The label was not clear. What does the dropdown ask? Project type? How you heard about them? I was not sure. I also did not see a phone number or email address easily. Sometimes I prefer to call or email instead of filling a form. I had to look for it. I think it was in the footer. It was not obvious. For someone who struggles with forms or prefers to talk, that is a barrier.

**What worked:** The page structure was okay. I could use headings to jump between sections. The statistics were clear. The form labels for Name, Email, Company were understandable. The navigation was consistent—same menu on each page. I did not get lost. I could always go back. The design looked professional. I trusted it was a real company.

**What did not work:** Too much jargon. AI-centric, bespoke, agentic, discovery process, seamless handoff, cross-functional, proof of concept—I had to guess or skip. Idioms like "harness the power" and "move the needle" (if I saw them)—I do not understand. Acronyms without expansion—ROI, MVP, UAT—I had to look them up. Long sentences with many ideas—I had to re-read. The hero did not tell me clearly what they do. The six service boxes used marketing language. The testimonials repeated the same difficult words. "Connect with an Expert" instead of "Contact"—I had to decode. The contact form was buried below five testimonials. No plain-language summary anywhere. I had to piece it together from multiple pages.

**Would I contact them?** Yes, I think so. I found that they build websites and apps, they work with AI, they do strategy and design. I found the contact form. I could fill it out. But I am not confident. If their own website is full of words I do not understand, will they understand my needs when I write to them? Will they use the same jargon in our conversations? I worry about that. I also had to work harder than I should have. A native speaker might skim and understand. I had to read slowly, re-read, skip, and guess. That is exhausting. On a busy day, I might have given up and looked at another agency.

**Rating: 2.5 out of 5.** I completed the task. I found what they do and how to contact them. But it cost me. The jargon, idioms, acronyms, and marketing language created barriers at every step. A 3 would mean it was acceptable. A 2 would mean I nearly gave up. I am in between. I got there, but I did not feel welcome. I felt like the site was written for people who already know the industry. I am a product manager. I work in tech. I am not an outsider. And still I struggled. What about someone with less exposure to these terms? They might leave before they understand anything.

## Additional Reflections

**On jargon:** Every time I see "bespoke" or "agentic" or "discovery process," I have to pause. My brain tries to find a simpler word. Sometimes I cannot. I skip. I move on. I miss information. When a company wants to reach international clients—like me, in India—they should use words that travel. "Custom" instead of "bespoke." "We learn about your needs" instead of "discovery process." "AI that works on its own" instead of "agentic AI." It is not dumbing down. It is being clear. Clarity helps everyone.

**On idioms:** "Harness the power" and "move the needle" do not translate. If I put them in Google Translate, I get nonsense. Idioms assume cultural knowledge I do not have. When marketing copy uses them, I am excluded. I prefer: "Use AI to improve your business" instead of "Harness the power of AI." "Get real results" instead of "Move the needle." Literal language works across languages and cultures.

**On acronyms:** ROI, MVP, UAT, UX—spell them out once. "ROI (Return on Investment)" on first use. Then I know. I can recognize "ROI" later. When they are not explained, I feel like the site assumes I am in the club. I am not. I am evaluating vendors. I need to understand. One line of expansion would fix it.

**On trust:** When I cannot understand a company's website, I wonder: will they understand me? Will our communication be clear? If they cannot explain themselves simply, how will they explain their process to me? How will they understand my requirements? The confusion on the site made me less confident. I would still reach out. But I would go in with lower expectations. I would prepare to ask more questions. I would maybe look at one or two other agencies first, to compare. Clarity builds trust. Confusion does not.

**On the contact form:** The form itself was okay. The labels were readable. But putting five long testimonials above it was wrong. I came to contact. Let me contact. Put the form first. Put testimonials below. Or on a different page. Do not make me scroll through marketing copy to do my task. That is disrespectful of my time.

**On what would have helped:** One sentence at the top of the homepage: "We build websites and mobile apps for businesses. We help you add AI to your products. Contact us to discuss your project." Simple. Clear. No jargon. No idioms. That would have answered my first question in five seconds. Then I could explore the rest. Instead I had to dig. I had to visit Services, About, Work, and piece it together. The Work page said "Our Portfolio of Web & Mobile Software." That was clearer. Web and mobile software—websites and apps. I wish the homepage had said that first.

**On translation tools:** I sometimes use Google Translate or DeepL for difficult pages. But they fail on idioms. "Harness the power" becomes something strange. They fail on jargon. "Bespoke" might translate to a word in Hindi that I do not use. They fail on acronyms. ROI stays ROI. The tools are not a solution. The content should be clear in the first place.

**On the Services page:** I clicked Services to understand better. The page said "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." More of the same words. AI-Focused, AI-Centric—I still did not get a simple answer. The service descriptions used "discovery and stakeholder alignment," "product strategy and roadmap," "UX research." I know UX. But "stakeholder alignment" and "roadmap" in this context—I had to infer. The About page said "Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Okay, they are a firm in Chicago. But "digital product firm"—what does that mean in plain words? I had to go to the Work page. "Our Portfolio of Web & Mobile Software." Portfolio means examples. Web and mobile software means websites and phone apps. Finally, something clear. But I had to visit three pages to get that. The homepage should have said it first.

**On consistency:** I noticed the site uses "Connect with an Expert" in the nav. If the Contact page or footer said "Get in Touch" or "Reach Out," that would add confusion. Which word do I look for? I need one word. "Contact" everywhere. Consistency helps me. When every page uses a different phrase, I have to decode each time. That costs energy.

**On the form dropdown:** The contact form had a dropdown. I did not know what it was for. Project type? Budget? How you heard about them? The label was not visible or clear. For a non-native speaker, unclear form labels are a barrier. I might leave a field blank. I might choose the wrong option. I might abandon the form. Clear labels matter.

**On case studies:** I glanced at the Work section. Case studies with project names. I did not read them in detail because I knew what I would find: more paragraphs, more jargon. "Transformative digital experiences," "operational efficiency," "scalable solutions"—these phrases do not tell me what they actually built. I prefer: "We built an app for X company that reduced support calls by 40%." Concrete. I can understand that. Abstract claims do not help me decide if they are right for my project.

**On comparison to other agencies:** I have looked at other digital agencies. Some use simpler language. Some say "We build websites and apps" right at the top. LaunchPad Lab is not the worst. But it is not the best for someone like me. The bar for "good" is: can I understand what they do in under two minutes? Can I find the contact form without guessing? Can I do it without looking up five words? I could not. I had to work for it. A site that gets it right would feel effortless. I would leave thinking, "I understand. I can contact them." I left thinking, "I think I understand. I hope I got it right."

**On American business culture:** Some phrases assume I know American business culture. "Silicon Valley" norms, "move fast and break things," sports metaphors—these do not always translate. I work in India. Our business culture is different. When a website assumes I share that context, I feel like an outsider. Plain language and concrete examples work everywhere. They do not assume I know a specific culture. That is why I prefer them.

**On recommending the site:** Would I tell a colleague in India to use this site? I would say: "You can find the information, but bring your patience. The words are difficult. Look up 'bespoke' and 'agentic' before you start. Use the Work page—it says 'web and mobile software' which is clearer. The contact form is below a lot of testimonials, so scroll down. Good luck." That is not a strong recommendation. A site that works for international users would not need that warning.

**On what "accessible" means for me:** When people talk about accessibility, they often mean screen readers, keyboard navigation, contrast. Those matter. But for me, accessibility also means: can I understand the words? Can I complete my task without a dictionary? Can I find the contact form without decoding five different labels? Language is an accessibility issue. If the content is written only for native speakers, I am excluded. LaunchPad Lab builds digital products. I hope they consider users like me when they build for their clients. Their own website would be a good place to start.

**Final thoughts:** I am used to English websites being written for native speakers. I have developed strategies. I skim. I use headings. I skip what I cannot understand. I look up words. I re-read. I got through LaunchPad Lab because I have practice. But it should not be this hard. A company that works with international clients should write for international readers. Plain language. No idioms. Acronyms expanded. One clear sentence at the top. That is not too much to ask. I completed my task. I found what they do and how to contact them. But I left tired. I did not feel welcome. I hope this feedback helps them do better.
