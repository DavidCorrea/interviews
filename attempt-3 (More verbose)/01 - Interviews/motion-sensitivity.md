## First-Person Narrative

I opened the LaunchPad Lab site because I'm evaluating them for a potential partnership. I'd heard they're an AI-centric digital product design and development firm in Chicago—exactly the kind of vendor I need. I have `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` set in my macOS. I've had it set for years. I expect professional websites to honor it. LaunchPad Lab did not.

**The hero hit me first.** I landed on the homepage and the hero section filled the viewport. Headline, supporting copy, maybe a visual. I don't remember the exact content because within seconds I felt it—that familiar pull in my stomach. Something was moving. Parallax, maybe. Background layers shifting at different speeds as I scrolled. Or a fade-in on load. My brain received mixed signals: the page appeared to move while I was stationary. Dizziness. Mild at first. I had to look away from the screen for a moment. Breathe. This is how it always starts.

**I scrolled down. Bad idea.** Every scroll triggered something. Client logos—did they fade in? Slide in? I couldn't tell you exactly. I just know that as soon as I moved the page, elements appeared with motion. Not static. Not instant. Motion. Fade-ins, slide-ins. My vestibular system doesn't care about the technical difference. It all reads as: the world is moving and I am not. Dizziness intensified. I felt a slight nausea building. I paused. Waited for it to settle. This is my life on the web. Scroll, trigger, suffer, pause, repeat.

**The six service boxes.** I needed to understand what they do. Discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, managed support—I got that from the headings. But each box had a hover effect. I discovered that the hard way. I Tabbed through the page, trying to avoid hover. When I landed on a service card, I didn't hover—I focused. But then I moved my mouse to click something and my cursor passed over a box. Lift. Scale. Shadow transition. The card rose and grew. My stomach dropped. Literally. I felt it. Six boxes. Six potential triggers. I tried to read the content without hovering. It was possible, but the layout invited interaction. I couldn't avoid passing over them entirely. Each accidental hover was a small assault. By the time I'd scanned all six, I had a headache starting. Tension. Behind my eyes.

**Statistics section.** Numbers. 12+ years, 730+ projects, 4.8 rating. Useful information. But did they count up? Animate in? Stagger? I scrolled into view and—yes. Something animated. Numbers rolling or fading. Staggered reveals. Multiple elements, one after another. Prolonged motion. I looked away. I couldn't watch. I closed my eyes for three seconds. When I looked back, the animation had finished. The content was there. I could read it. But the damage was done. Nausea. Stronger now. I needed to find the contact form and get out.

**Award badges.** Seven or more. I didn't hover. I didn't want to know what would happen. I Tabbed past. If they had motion on hover, I never triggered it. Small mercy.

**Testimonials.** Long quote blocks. I'd read about these from other personas—dense, italic text. For me, the problem was different. Did they fade in on scroll? Slide in? I scrolled past and felt the motion. Another trigger. Another wave of dizziness. I didn't read the quotes. I couldn't. I was too busy managing my body. Don't throw up. Don't close the tab. Find the contact form. Get out.

**Case studies.** Cards. Thumbnails. I didn't hover. I knew better. Hover on cards means lift, scale, shadow. I Tabbed. I saw enough to know they have portfolio work. I didn't need to explore. I needed to leave.

**The Contact page.** I clicked "Connect with an Expert." New page. Testimonials above the form—five of them. Same problem. Did they animate on scroll? I scrolled down. Yes. Fade-ins. Or slide-ins. I felt each one. By the time I reached the form, I was queasy. Headache full-blown. I could see the form. Name, email, company, dropdown, message. I could have filled it out. But I didn't want to stay. I'd found what I needed. They do AI-centric digital product design and development. I could contact them via this form. Task complete. I closed the tab.

**Did I check for carousels?** I don't think I saw auto-advancing content. Client logos might have been a static grid. Testimonials might have been static blocks. If there was a carousel somewhere, I didn't scroll far enough to hit it. Or I blocked it out. Auto-advancing carousels are the worst. Uncontrollable. Continuous. I would have left immediately. The fact that I made it to the contact form suggests the motion was bad but not carousel-level bad. Still. Bad enough.

**`prefers-reduced-motion`.** I had it set. I verified before the test. System Preferences → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion. Checked. The site ignored it. Every scroll-triggered animation fired. Every hover effect triggered. No reduction. No respect. I feel disregarded when that happens. My accessibility needs are explicit. The site chose to ignore them. That's not a bug. That's a choice.

**When would I have abandoned?** If the hero had been more aggressive—parallax that made the room feel like it was tilting—I might have closed the tab in the first 10 seconds. If there had been an auto-advancing carousel, I would have left within 20. As it was, I pushed through. I'm used to pushing through. I've developed tolerance. Not everyone with vestibular issues can. A first-time visitor, someone newly diagnosed, might have given up at the service boxes. Six hover effects in a row. That's a lot.

**What I found:** LaunchPad Lab does AI-centric digital product design and development. Services include discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, and managed support. Contact is via "Connect with an Expert" in the nav, which leads to a form. Testimonials sit above the form. I got the information. I completed the task. But it cost me. Headache. Nausea. Dizziness. I took a break after. I didn't fill out the form. I might later. Or I might choose a competitor whose site doesn't make me sick.

**Rating: 1.5 out of 5.** I completed the task. Barely. The motion was constant. Scroll-triggered animations on every section. Hover effects on interactive elements. No `prefers-reduced-motion` support. No pause controls. No way to reduce or disable motion. I had to endure physical symptoms to get the information. A 2 would mean it was difficult but tolerable. A 1 would mean I couldn't complete the task. I'm in between. I got there. But I felt sick. I don't feel welcome. I don't feel like the site was designed for users like me.

## Additional Reflections

**On the physical toll:** I want to be clear. This isn't about preference. It's about my body. Dizziness, nausea, headaches—these are involuntary. I can't "power through" in the sense of ignoring them. I can only endure them for a limited time. After 2–3 significant motion events, symptoms escalate. On LaunchPad Lab, I hit way more than 2–3. I hit a dozen or more. Scroll-triggered effects on hero, logos, services, statistics, testimonials, case studies. Hover effects on six service boxes. Each one added to the load. By the end, I was running on fumes. I completed the task because I was doing an evaluation. In real life, I might have left after the service boxes. "I'll contact them later," I'd tell myself. And maybe I wouldn't.

**On `prefers-reduced-motion`:** It exists for a reason. It's in the spec. Browsers support it. Operating systems support it. Users like me set it. And then we land on sites like this, and nothing changes. The animations still fire. The hover effects still trigger. It feels like the industry doesn't care. Or doesn't know. Both are unacceptable for a digital product firm. They build experiences for clients. They should know that `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` is a few lines of CSS. Or a check in JavaScript before running scroll observers. It's not hard. It's just not done.

**On what would have helped:** Reduce or eliminate scroll-triggered animations when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set. Content can appear instantly. No fade, no slide, no stagger. Same information. Zero motion. For hover effects—disable the motion. Keep the hover state (color change, underline) but remove lift, scale, shadow transitions. Or provide a site-level toggle: "Reduce motion." Let me turn it off. Give me control. I don't need the site to be static for everyone. I need it to be static for me.

**On the Contact page:** Testimonials above the form meant I had to scroll through more animated content to reach the form. For a motion-sensitive user, that's cruel. Put the form first. Or add a "Skip to contact form" link. Let me bypass the motion-heavy content. I don't care about testimonials when I'm trying to contact you. I care about not getting sick.

**On whether I'd recommend the site:** I would tell a colleague with vestibular issues: "Don't go there. Or go with your eyes closed and Tab to the contact form." The content exists. The information is findable. But the journey is punishing. A digital product firm that builds accessible experiences should not have a site that triggers physical symptoms. It's a contradiction. Fix it.

**On comparison to other sites:** I've visited sites that respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. When I land on them, nothing moves. Content appears. I can read. I can navigate. I feel included. LaunchPad Lab is not one of those sites. It's in the majority—sites that ignore the preference. That doesn't make it okay. It makes it normal. Normal is not acceptable.

**On keyboard navigation:** I used Tab to move through the page. It helped. I didn't have to hover over every element to discover links. But Tab doesn't protect me from scroll-triggered animations. Every time I scrolled—whether by mouse wheel, trackpad, or Page Down—something animated. Keyboard can't fix that. The only fix is for the site to stop animating.

**On the statistics count-up:** If those numbers rolled or counted up when they came into view, that's a specific trigger. Numeric animation—digits changing rapidly—can be as bad as flashing. I didn't watch long enough to confirm. I looked away. But if it's there, it needs to go when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set. Static numbers. No animation.

**On the Contact page testimonials:** Five blocks. Same problem as the homepage. I had to scroll through them to reach the form. Each scroll, each new block in view—motion. Why put testimonials above the form? For a motion-sensitive user, it's an obstacle course. Put the form first. Or let me skip. I don't need to read five quotes to contact you. I need to not get sick.

**On what "good" would look like:** I land on the site. I have `prefers-reduced-motion` set. Nothing moves. Content is there. I scroll. Content appears. Instantly. No fade. No slide. No stagger. I hover over a service box. Maybe the border changes color. Maybe there's an underline. No lift. No scale. No shadow transition. I reach the contact form. I fill it out. I leave. I feel fine. That's it. That's the bar.

**On the emotional toll:** When a site ignores my preference, it feels like the site doesn't want me there. It feels like I'm an afterthought. I'm a product manager. I evaluate vendors. I have budget. I have influence. And I have a vestibular disorder. When LaunchPad Lab's site made me sick, I didn't feel like a valued prospect. I felt like an inconvenience. That's not how you want your potential clients to feel.

**On browser extensions:** I've tried "Reduce Motion" extensions for Chrome. They block some CSS animations. But many sites—including this one, I suspect—use JavaScript. Scroll observers. Intersection Observer. Libraries like Framer Motion or GSAP. Those don't respond to CSS overrides. The extension can't touch them. So I'm left with my OS preference. And when the site ignores that too, I have nothing. No tool. No workaround. Just endure or leave.

**On the hero section specifically:** The first viewport is critical. If the hero has parallax or a load animation, that's the first thing I experience. Before I've read a word. Before I've decided if I want to stay. The motion hits. My body reacts. I'm already compromised. Everything that follows—the service boxes, the testimonials—builds on that. A calm hero would have given me a fighting chance. A motion-heavy hero set me up to fail.

**On direct navigation:** If I'd known the URL, I could have gone straight to /contact. Bypassed the homepage entirely. Fewer sections, fewer scroll-triggered animations. The Contact page still had motion—testimonials above the form—but less density than the homepage. For future visits, I might bookmark the contact form. It's a workaround. Not a solution. The solution is for the site to respect my preference.

**Final thoughts:** I found what they do. I found how to contact them. I completed the task. But I left feeling sick and disregarded. The site was not built for users like me. That's a failure. I hope this feedback helps them do better.

**One last thing:** Vestibular disorders are invisible. You can't see my dizziness. You can't see my nausea. Designers and developers might not think about users like me when they add animations. "It looks nice," they say. "It's engaging." For me, it's harmful. I'm sharing this so they know. The animations have a cost. Real people pay it. I'm one of them.
