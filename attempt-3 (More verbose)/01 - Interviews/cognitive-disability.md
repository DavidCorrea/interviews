## First-Person Narrative

I opened the website and the first thing I saw was a big headline: "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." I had to read it three times. What does "AI-centric" mean? Is that the same as AI? And "digital product design"—does that mean they make websites? Or apps? Or something else? I wasn't sure. I felt confused right away.

I took a breath. My friend said they build websites and apps. So maybe that headline is just a fancy way of saying that. But why use fancy words? I had to guess. That made me feel uncertain.

I like to go slowly. I read each word. I don't skim. When there are too many things at once, I get stuck. I need to know: what do I do first? What do I do next? This site had a lot going on from the start.

Before I started, I had two goals. One: find out what this company does. Two: find out how to contact them. I wrote those down so I wouldn't forget. I'm good at staying on task when I have a clear list. When things get fuzzy, I lose my place.

I looked at the top of the page for a menu. I saw four things: Work, Services, About, and something that said "Connect with an Expert."

I paused. Work and Services—what's the difference? I thought maybe Work means the jobs they've done, and Services means what they offer. But I wasn't sure.

And "Connect with an Expert"—is that a button? A link? What expert? Do I click it to contact them? The label didn't tell me clearly what would happen. I like when things say what they do. "Contact" does that. "Connect with an Expert" doesn't.

I scrolled down slowly. There were a lot of logos. I think those are companies they worked with. That's okay. That part was fine.

But then I saw six boxes in a row. Six. I stopped. That's too many. I can only hold a few things in my head at once. Six is too many. I read somewhere that most people can hold about five to seven things. I'm on the lower end. Three to five. So six boxes meant I had to make a choice: read them all and forget the first ones, or just pick a couple. I tried to read them one by one. "AI Automation"—maybe that's about robots or something? "Web Apps"—that one I kind of get. Websites and apps. "Agentic AI"—I don't know what that means. "Bespoke"—I've heard that word before but I'm not sure. Is it like custom? "Cross-functional" and "discovery process"—these words blurred together. I felt overwhelmed. I couldn't hold all six in my head. I just wanted to know: do they build websites? Yes or no? A simple answer. One of those boxes probably said it. But I couldn't process all six to find out.

I kept scrolling. There were numbers—statistics, I think. Percentages and maybe years. I didn't really process them. And award badges. Seven or more. I didn't know what to do with that information. It didn't help me understand what they do. Awards are nice, I guess. But they didn't answer my question.

Then testimonials. Long quotes from people. One said something about "discovery process" and "selective choice of questioning" and "business units" and "marketing strategy." I read it twice. I still didn't get it. Who are these people talking to? What did Launchpad Lab actually do for them? The words were too fancy. I couldn't picture what happened. Did they build a website? An app? I had to guess. Another testimonial mentioned "7% increase in online membership sales and general admission tickets." That one was a bit clearer—something about a system they built that helped with sales. But "discovery process" and "selective choice of questioning" — I had no idea what those meant. I moved on. I didn't want to get stuck.

I went back to the top. I needed to find Contact. That was my second goal. I looked at the menu again. "Connect with an Expert"—maybe that's it? I wasn't sure. I didn't see a word that said "Contact" clearly. I'm used to looking for "Contact" or "Contact Us." Those words tell me exactly what I'll get. "Connect with an Expert" could mean a lot of things. A chat? A phone call? A form? I had to guess. I looked at the bottom of the page. There's usually a footer with links. I scrolled all the way down. It took a long time. The page felt very long. When I got there, I had to look through a lot of links. Finally I found something about contact or getting in touch. I think I found it. But it wasn't obvious. I had to hunt for it.

I clicked to go to the Contact page. The first thing I saw was more testimonials. Five long quotes, one after another. I had to scroll past all of them before I could see the form. Why are testimonials above the form? I wanted to fill out the form. That was my goal. I had to scroll and scroll. It felt like a long way. I wondered if I was on the right page. Maybe I clicked the wrong thing? I kept scrolling. Finally—the form. When I finally saw the form, I had to figure out what each field was. Name—okay. Email—okay. Company—do I have a company? I work at a grocery store. Maybe I leave that blank? A dropdown—I didn't know what the dropdown was for. Maybe "type of project"? Or "how did you hear about us"? The label wasn't clear. And a message box. The labels were there, but the order felt like a lot. I wondered: which fields do I have to fill? Are some optional? I didn't see clear "required" markers. I felt tired. I wasn't sure I wanted to fill it out right then. I might come back later. At least I found it. That was something.

What worked: The page had a structure. I could scroll top to bottom. That's how I like to read. Left to right, top to bottom.

The navigation stayed in the same place when I moved between pages. That helped. I didn't have to learn a new layout each time.

The form fields had labels. That's good. The "Submit" or send button—when I found it—said what it does. I like when buttons say what they do.

The headings on the page (when they existed) helped me know what section I was in. I use headings like a map.

The design looked professional, so I trusted it was a real company. I didn't worry about it being a scam.

What didn't work: Too many choices at once. Six services. That's too many. I froze for a moment.

Too much jargon. "AI-centric," "digital product design," "development firm," "agentic AI," "bespoke," "cross-functional," "discovery process"—I couldn't understand most of it. I had to skip over those words or guess.

"Connect with an Expert" didn't tell me it was the way to contact them. I had to figure that out.

The contact form was buried below testimonials. I had to work hard to figure out what the company does.

A simple sentence at the top like "We build websites and apps for businesses" would have helped a lot. One clear sentence. That's all I needed.

By the end, I could say: they build websites and apps, and they do something with AI. I found the contact form. But it took me a long time. I felt confused and overwhelmed in the middle. If I had been having a bad day, I might have given up.

I also tried clicking on "Services" to understand better. The page said "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." More of the same words. I still didn't get a simple answer. "About" said "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Okay, so they're a firm. In Chicago. But what does a "digital product firm" do? I had to guess. "Work" showed "Our Portfolio of Web & Mobile Software." Portfolio—I think that means examples of their work. Web and mobile software—that's websites and phone apps. Finally, something I could understand. But I had to go to a different page to get that. The homepage didn't say it clearly. I wish the homepage had said "We build websites and mobile apps" right at the top. In plain words. Then I could have skipped a lot of the confusion. I could have gone straight to finding the contact form. Instead I had to visit multiple pages and piece it together. The navigation was consistent—same menu on each page—so I didn't get lost. I could always click "Home" or the logo to go back. That helped. But the content itself was the hard part.

The whole experience made me tired. I had to work hard to piece together what they do. I had to scroll a lot. I had to figure out that "Connect with an Expert" meant contact. I had to scroll past five testimonials to reach the form. Each step took extra time. I had to re-read things. I had to stop and think. On a day when I'm already tired or stressed, I might have closed the tab and given up.

I didn't look at the case studies in detail. I saw there were examples of their work somewhere. But by that point I had already spent a lot of time. I had my answer: they build websites and apps. I didn't need to see every project. Sometimes less is more. I get overwhelmed when there's too much to look at.

One thing that would have helped: a clear "Contact" link right in the main menu. Not "Connect with an Expert." Just "Contact." Or "Get in Touch." Words I know. Words that tell me what will happen when I click. Same with the form—put it first. Before the testimonials. I came to the Contact page to contact them. I didn't come to read five long quotes first. Let me do my task. Then show me the testimonials if you want. Another thing: fewer service boxes. Maybe three main things instead of six. Or group them. "We build websites" and "We build apps" and "We help with AI" — something like that. Short. Clear. One idea per box. I don't need to know every detail right away. I just need to know if they can help me. And how to ask.

I'm glad I finished. I found what I needed. But it shouldn't have been this hard. My friend was right—they do build websites and apps. The website just didn't say it simply. It said it in a way that assumes you already know the words. I don't. And that's okay. Websites should work for people like me too.

I use the computer for email, banking, and looking up businesses. I'm not an expert. I don't use keyboard shortcuts or screen readers. I just click and scroll. I need things to be clear. When they're not, I get tired. I make mistakes. Sometimes I give up. This time I didn't give up. But I came close when I saw those six boxes. And when I had to scroll past five testimonials to find the form. Small things add up. When a site is easy, I feel good. When it's hard, I feel like I'm not smart enough. I know that's not true. But that's how it feels.

**Rating: 2 out of 5.** I completed my goals, but it was harder than it should have been. The site felt like it was written for people who already know the industry. I needed simpler words and fewer choices. I would use this site again if I had to. But I'd need to be patient. And have time. And not be tired when I start.

*Summary for the team: Jordan (cognitive disability persona) completed both goals—understood that Launchpad Lab builds websites and apps, and found the contact form—but experienced significant confusion and overwhelm. Main barriers: jargon-heavy language, six service choices at once, unclear "Connect with an Expert" label, contact form buried below testimonials, and no plain-language summary of what the company does. What helped: consistent navigation, labeled form fields, linear scroll, professional design. Recommend adding plain-language hero text, explicit "Contact" in nav, form above testimonials, and reducing/grouping service options.*
