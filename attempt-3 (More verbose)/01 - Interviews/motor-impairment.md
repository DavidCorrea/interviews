## First-Person Narrative

I'm Sam. I'm a product director at a healthcare company. I have essential tremor—my hands shake when I try to do precise movements. I've used keyboard navigation as my primary input for over a decade. I don't use a mouse for clicking. I can't. The cursor drifts. Small targets are impossible. I Tab. I press Enter. I use Space. That's how I browse. I opened LaunchPad Lab's site because I'm researching digital product agencies for an upcoming initiative. I'd heard they're AI-focused and based in Chicago. I wanted to understand their services and find how to contact them—all without touching a mouse.

**I pressed Tab.** The page loaded. Where did focus go? I couldn't tell. I pressed Tab again. And again. Nothing visible. No outline. No ring. No change. I was tabbing blind. I kept going. Tab. Tab. Tab. I counted. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I must have gone through the logo, maybe some nav items. I couldn't see where I was. The focus indicator—if there was one—was invisible. I've seen this before. Designers remove the default browser focus ring because they think it's ugly. For me, it's a lifeline. Without it, I'm lost.

**There was no skip link.** I knew that by tab ten. I tabbed through every header element, every nav item, every decorative link before I reached anything that looked like main content. I counted twenty-three tabs before I reached the hero section. Twenty-three. I was already tired. My fingers were tired. My neck was stiff from leaning in, trying to see if anything had focus. A skip link would have gotten me there in one or two. "Skip to main content." One Tab. Enter. Done. I would have had energy left. Instead, I'd spent it all before I'd even read anything.

**The navigation links were tiny.** Work. Services. About. Connect with an Expert. When I finally focused them—I think I did—I couldn't tell. The focus ring was faint. A thin gray line. Maybe 1px. On a light background. I squinted. Was that focus? Or was that nothing? I pressed Enter on what I hoped was "Connect with an Expert." The page changed. I'd hit the right one. But I'd guessed. I shouldn't have to guess.

**The service boxes.** Six of them. Each had a "Learn More" link. I tabbed through. One, two, three, four, five, six. Each link—when I could see focus—was small. The clickable area felt like 20 pixels. Maybe 25. Not 44. The WCAG 2.5.5 target size is 44×44. I know that. I've read it. I've advocated for it. These links were nowhere close. I tried to activate one. I pressed Enter. It worked. But the target was so small that if I'd been using a trackball—which I sometimes do for coarse movement—I would have misclicked. I would have hit the wrong link or missed entirely. With keyboard, I got there. But the effort of tabbing through six small links, each with barely visible focus, drained me.

**The "View project" links.** Same problem. In the case studies section, each project had a link. Small. Inline. Under 44 pixels. I tabbed through them. I lost count of how many tabs. I was in the thirties by then. I'd given up on counting. I just wanted to reach the contact form. I could feel the fatigue. My tremor gets worse when I'm tired. More tabs. More imprecision. More frustration.

**The arrow icons.** I saw carousel or slider controls. Arrow buttons. Left. Right. I tabbed to them. Were they 44 pixels? No. They were tiny. Icon-only. No visible label. I didn't know what they did until I activated one. The page shifted. A carousel. I'd moved it. But the target was so small that if I'd been using a pointer—even a trackball—I would have missed. Keyboard saved me. But the design didn't.

**The Contact page.** I'd gotten there via "Connect with an Expert." I landed on a page full of testimonials. Five long blocks. Above the form. I had to tab through all of them. More links. More small targets. I tabbed. I tabbed. I tabbed. I lost track. Finally—the form. Name. Email. Company. A dropdown. Message. I could reach each field. I could tab through them. The focus indicator on the inputs—was it visible? Barely. A thin outline. I could see it if I looked hard. But it wasn't 2px. It wasn't high contrast. It wasn't the 3:1 minimum I need. I filled out the fields. I tabbed to the submit button. I pressed Enter. It worked. But the submit button—was it 44 pixels? I'd say it was borderline. Maybe 40. I could activate it. But it wasn't generous. And the focus ring—when I was on it—was faint. I could have missed it.

**Hover-dependent interactions.** I didn't test every dropdown. But I've seen navigation menus that only open on hover. I can't hover. I can't hold a cursor steady. If the main nav has dropdowns that require hover to reveal—Work, Services, About—I didn't see them. I couldn't open them. I tabbed through. I got links. I didn't get submenus. If there were submenus, they were hidden from me. I couldn't access them. That's a barrier. All functionality must be available via keyboard. Focus + Enter. Focus + Space. No hover.

**The fatigue was real.** By the time I reached the contact form, I'd tabbed through forty-plus elements. Maybe fifty. I didn't have the energy to go back and verify. I'd completed the task. I found what they do: AI-centric digital product design and development. Discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, support. I found the contact form. I could have submitted it. But I was exhausted. I would have abandoned the task earlier if I hadn't been doing this evaluation. On a normal day, I might have closed the tab after twenty tabs. "I'll contact them later," I'd tell myself. And maybe I wouldn't.

**What worked:** The site was keyboard-operable. I could reach every interactive element with Tab. I could activate links and buttons with Enter. I didn't hit a focus trap. I didn't get stuck in a modal or carousel. The form was reachable. The form fields were in logical order. I could complete the task. That's the baseline. It's not nothing.

**What didn't work:** No skip link. Invisible or faint focus indicators. Small targets everywhere—nav links, "Learn More," "View project," arrow icons, secondary CTAs. Excessive tabbing. Twenty-three tabs to main content. Forty-plus to the contact form. I lost my place repeatedly. I couldn't see where focus was. I was tabbing blind. I fatigued from the effort. Hover-dependent interactions—if any—were inaccessible. I couldn't use them.

**Would I contact them?** I completed the task. I found the form. I could have filled it out. But the journey was exhausting. A digital product design firm—one that builds experiences for clients—should know that users like me exist. We're not edge cases. We're a significant part of the population. Motor impairment, essential tremor, limited dexterity—we use keyboards. We need visible focus. We need adequate target sizes. We need skip links. We need efficient paths. If their own site fails at these basics, what does that say about the products they build for others? I'd question their commitment to inclusive design.

**Rating: 2 out of 5.** I completed the task. I found what they do and how to contact them. But it cost me. I tabbed through forty-plus elements. I couldn't see focus half the time. The targets were too small. I had no skip link. I fatigued. A 3 would mean it was tolerable. A 2 means I got there, but I'm tired, and I don't feel welcome. A design firm's site should demonstrate their values. This one didn't.

## Additional Reflections

**On skip links:** I've advocated for skip links on every project I've worked on. They're trivial to implement. One link. One Tab. Enter. You're at main content. The absence of a skip link on this site—a design and development firm—is inexcusable. It forces twenty-plus tabs before I can read anything meaningful. That's a barrier. Fix it.

**On focus indicators:** I need 2px solid outline. 3:1 contrast minimum. I need to see where I am at all times. Faint, thin, or missing focus rings mean I lose my place. I lose my place, I make mistakes. I make mistakes, I get frustrated. I get frustrated, I leave. Visible focus is not optional. It's essential.

**On target size:** 44×44 pixels. That's the minimum. I've read the research. I've lived it. Targets smaller than that cause misclicks. I hit the wrong link. I miss entirely. I give up. The nav links, the "Learn More" links, the "View project" links, the arrow icons, the secondary CTAs—they're all too small. Add padding. Increase the hit area. Make it 44 pixels. It's not that hard.

**On excessive tabbing:** I tabbed through forty-plus elements. I counted twenty-three tabs before main content. That's too many. I fatigued. My tremor gets worse when I'm tired. More tabs, more errors, more fatigue. A skip link would have cut that to one or two. Logical tab order helps. Grouping related elements helps. Reducing the number of focusable decorative elements helps. Every tab costs me something.

**On hover:** I cannot hover. I cannot hold a cursor steady. If any dropdown, menu, tooltip, or carousel control requires hover—it's inaccessible to me. I didn't encounter an obvious hover trap in my quick pass. But I've seen navigation menus that only open on hover. I've seen "Learn more" content that reveals on hover. If this site has those, they're barriers. All functionality must be available via keyboard. Focus + Enter. Focus + Space. No hover.

**On the emotional toll:** When a site is hard to navigate with a keyboard—when I can't see focus, when I have to tab through dozens of elements, when I'm exhausted before I've reached my goal—it feels like the site doesn't want me there. I'm 45. I've spent decades adapting. I use keyboard. I avoid mouse. I've developed strategies. But I shouldn't have to fight the design. A digital product firm—one that builds experiences for clients—should know that users like me exist. If their own site doesn't accommodate us, what does that say about the products they build?

**On comparison to other agencies:** I've looked at other digital product firms. Some have skip links. Some have visible focus. Some have larger targets. LaunchPad Lab isn't the worst—I didn't hit a focus trap. I didn't get stuck in a modal. The form was reachable. But it's not good enough. The bar for "acceptable" for me is: can I reach main content in under five tabs? Can I see where focus is at all times? Can I activate every link and button without misclicking? I couldn't. I had to tab twenty-plus times. I couldn't see focus half the time. The targets were too small. A site that gets it right would feel effortless. I'd leave thinking, "That was easy." I didn't leave thinking that.

**On what "good" would look like:** A skip link as the first focusable element. A 2px solid focus ring with 3:1 contrast on every interactive element. All targets at least 44×44 pixels. No hover-only interactions. Contact form above testimonials. Logical tab order. That's it. Those changes would have transformed my experience. I would have left feeling included, not excluded. I wouldn't have needed to tab through forty-plus elements or strain to see where I was.

**On the footer:** I didn't spend much time in the footer. By the time I reached it, I was done. But footer links are often the smallest on the page. I'd want to verify: Are they 44 pixels? Can I see focus on them? From what I saw of the rest of the site, I'd guess they have the same problems. Small targets. Faint focus. If I needed to find a phone number or email in the footer, I'd have to work for it.

**On whether I'd recommend the site:** I'd tell a colleague with motor impairment: "You can get there, but bring your patience." The site is keyboard-operable. You won't get stuck. But you'll tab a lot. You'll lose your place. You'll fatigue. For an agency that does digital product work, it feels like a missed opportunity. They could demonstrate inclusive design right here. Instead, it feels like they designed for mouse users first.

**On error recovery:** I didn't trigger any form validation errors. But if I had—if I'd missed a required field or entered invalid data—how would I have recovered? Would focus move to the error message? Would I know what went wrong? With faint focus indicators, I might not even see where the error was. Error handling is critical for form completion. I'd want to verify that errors receive focus and are clearly announced. Without that, I might give up.

**On the "Connect with an Expert" CTA:** That button was my primary path to contact. It was styled as a button, so it had more presence than the nav links. I could reach it by keyboard. I could activate it. But was the target 44 pixels? I'm not sure. And the focus indicator—when I was on it—was it visible? I think I saw something. But I shouldn't have to guess. The primary CTA on a design firm's site should be unmistakably accessible: large target, clear focus, no ambiguity.

**Final thoughts:** I completed the task. I know LaunchPad Lab does AI-centric digital product design and development. I found the contact form via "Connect with an Expert." I could have filled it out. But the journey was exhausting. Every accessibility choice—the missing skip link, the faint focus, the small targets, the excessive tabbing—made it harder. Fix the basics. Respect users who rely on keyboard. It's not that hard.
