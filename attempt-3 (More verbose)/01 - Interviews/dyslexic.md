## First-Person Narrative

I opened the LaunchPad Lab site because I'd heard they're an AI-focused digital product firm in Chicago—exactly what I need for a project I'm evaluating. I'm a graphic designer, so I'm comfortable with visual information. But reading? That's different. I knew I'd have to work for it.

**The hero section was okay.** The headline "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development" is short enough that I could parse it. I didn't have to decode a wall of text right away. That helped. But the body text under it—whatever supporting copy they had—felt thin. The letters looked light, like they were fading into the background. I had to squint. I'm used to that, but it's exhausting before I've even started.

**The client logos were a relief.** Visual content. I didn't have to read anything. Logos, images, shapes—that's my comfort zone. I'm a graphic designer. I process visual information quickly. When a section has no text, or minimal text, I can breathe. I scanned the logos, got the message: they work with real companies. Done. More sections like that, please.

**I went straight for the navigation.** Headings and links are my lifeline. I don't read top to bottom—I jump. I saw Work, Services, About, and "Connect with an Expert." That last one—I had to read it twice. "Connect with an Expert" isn't "Contact." My brain wanted to find "Contact" and move on. I had to pause and decode. Is that the contact CTA? I think so. But it's not obvious. For someone like me, every extra moment of decoding costs energy.

**The services section broke me.** Six boxes. Each one had a description—paragraphs, not lists. I tried to skim. I know they do discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, managed support. I got that from headings and the first line of each box. But the paragraphs underneath? Five, six, seven lines of unbroken text. I lost my place constantly. I'd finish a line and my eyes would jump to the wrong one—skip ahead, double back. I read the same sentence about "aligning stakeholders" three times before it registered. And the text—gray. Light gray. #666, #777, somewhere in there. On white, it's like the letters are dissolving. I had to use my finger to track the line. Even then, the line height felt tight. The lines ran together. By the time I'd scanned all six boxes, I was already tired.

**The testimonials were the worst.** Long quote blocks. Italic text. I know from experience: italic distorts letter shapes. "b" and "d" get even harder to tell apart. "Their" and "there" blur. And these weren't short quotes—they were paragraphs. Four, five lines of italic prose. I tried to read the first one: something about "everybody here has been really impressed." I gave up halfway through. I couldn't sustain it. My accuracy was dropping. I skipped the rest. I know testimonials matter for credibility, but for me they were walls. I couldn't climb them.

**The statistics helped.** "12+ years," "730+ projects," "4.8 rating"—numbers and short labels. I could process those instantly. No decoding, no tracking. That's what I need. More of that.

**The award badges were fine.** Visual. I didn't have to read much. If there was small text on the badges, I didn't bother. I've learned to skip what I can't easily parse.

**Finding the contact form took effort.** I clicked "Connect with an Expert" and landed on the Contact page. But first—more testimonials. Five long quote blocks, stacked above the form. Same problem: italic, dense, long. I scrolled past them. I wasn't going to read them. I needed the form.

**The form itself was manageable.** Name, email, company, dropdown, message. The labels were clear. I could read them. But the labels—were they light gray too? I think so. I had to focus. The contrast wasn't great. If I'd been more fatigued, I might have misread "Company" as "Contact" or something. I didn't see a phone number or email in the main flow. I had to look for the footer. Did they have one? I'm not sure I found it easily. For someone who prefers to call or email, that's a barrier.

**What worked:** The overall structure wasn't terrible. I could use headings to jump. The hero headline was scannable. The statistics were easy. The navigation labels were mostly clear once I decoded them. The form labels were readable, if not ideal. The site didn't use justified text—that would have been worse. And it's sans-serif, which helps. No decorative fonts. So it wasn't a total failure.

**What didn't work:** The light gray text everywhere. The thin font weight. The tight line height. The long paragraphs in the service descriptions. The italic testimonial blocks. The density. I felt like I was wading through mud. Every block of prose cost me. I had to take a break after the services section. I came back to find the contact form. I wouldn't have persisted if I hadn't needed to complete this evaluation.

**Would I contact them?** Probably. I found what they do—AI-centric digital product design and development, discovery, strategy, UX, prototyping, support. I found the contact form. But I'd do it grudgingly. The site didn't respect my reading experience. A digital product firm that builds accessible experiences should know better. If their own site is hard for me to read, what does that say about the products they build for others?

**Rating: 2.5 out of 5.** I completed the task. I found the information. But it cost me. The typography worked against me at every turn. Light text, thin fonts, dense paragraphs, italic blocks—I had to fight the design to get the content. A 3 would mean it was tolerable. A 2 would mean I nearly gave up. I'm in between. I got there, but I'm tired, and I don't feel welcome.

## Additional Reflections

**On losing my place:** It happens all the time. I'll be reading a line, get to the end, and when I swing my eyes back to the start of the next line, I land on the wrong one. Maybe I jump up a line. Maybe I read the same line again. In the service descriptions, the paragraphs were so long that I'd lose my place two or three times per block. I had to use my finger on the screen to track. That helps, but it's embarrassing when you're in a coffee shop. And even with tracking, the tight line spacing meant the lines blurred together. There wasn't enough vertical space between them. My eyes couldn't find the next line cleanly.

**On fatigue:** Reading exhausts me. It's not like watching a video or looking at images. Every word requires effort. After the services section, I felt it. My comprehension was dropping. I was re-reading the same sentences and still not retaining them. I took a break. Closed the tab. Came back five minutes later to find the contact form. If I hadn't been doing this as an evaluation, I might have given up. "I'll contact them later," I would have told myself. And maybe I wouldn't have.

**On the light gray text:** This is the thing that frustrates me most. Designers love light gray. They think it looks elegant, subtle. For me, it's hostile. The letters don't pop. They blend. When I'm tired, they disappear. I've used browser extensions to force darker text on sites. It helps. But I shouldn't have to. A digital product firm—one that presumably builds accessible experiences for clients—should know that #666 on white is a barrier. It's not just me. It's anyone with low vision, anyone in bright light, anyone who's tired. Fix the contrast. It's the lowest-hanging fruit.

**On what would have helped:** Bullet points. So many bullet points. Instead of a paragraph about "aligning stakeholders and developing product roadmaps through collaborative workshops," give me: "Discovery & Strategy: workshops, roadmaps, stakeholder alignment." Three lines. I can read that. I can retain it. Same for every service. And the testimonials—if they had to be there, at least use regular font weight. Not italic. Or give me a one-line summary: "Client saw 7% increase in membership sales." I don't need the full quote. I need the signal, not the noise.

**On the structure:** The headings saved me. I could jump from "Services" to "About" to the contact form without reading everything in between. That's how I navigate. If the headings had been missing or illogical, I would have been lost. So that part worked. The information architecture was okay. It was the typography that failed.

**On letter confusion:** When text is light and thin, letters start to look alike. "form" and "from" — I have to slow down. "their" and "there" — same thing. In the testimonials, with the italic on top of everything, it got worse. I caught myself misreading "evolved" as "involved" at one point. I had to go back. That kind of thing happens all the time for me. Good typography — darker text, heavier weight, more spacing — reduces it. This site didn't give me that.

**On the contact form:** I could fill it out. The fields were labeled. Name, email, company, message. I didn't try the dropdown — those can be tricky when there are lots of options and small text. But the basics were there. My main concern was whether I'd misread a label when tired. "Company" and "Contact" both start with "Co." Small things like that can trip me. The labels could have been bolder, darker. More contrast would have given me confidence.

**On whether I'd recommend the site:** I'd tell a dyslexic colleague: "You can get the info, but bring your patience." The content is there. The structure is okay. But the reading experience is punishing. For an agency that does digital product work, it feels like a missed opportunity. They could demonstrate their values right here, on their own site. Instead, it feels like they designed for aesthetics first and accessibility second. Or not at all.

**On zoom and tools:** I sometimes use browser zoom at 125% or 150% when sites are hard to read. I didn't try it on LaunchPad Lab for this evaluation, but I suspect it would help — bigger text is easier for me. The question is whether the layout would break. Some sites get weird when you zoom: overlapping text, cut-off content, horizontal scrolling. If this site handles zoom well, that would be a plus. I'd want to test that. I've also used text-to-speech for long articles. The testimonials would have been a good candidate — let the computer read them to me instead of straining. But I'd need the page structure to make sense when read aloud. Headings, landmarks, logical order. From what I saw, the structure exists. So TTS might work. But I shouldn't have to rely on assistive tech to compensate for poor typography. The site should be readable on its own.

**On the Work page and case studies:** I glanced at the Work section. Case studies. Project descriptions. I didn't dive deep because I knew what I'd find: more paragraphs. More dense copy. More of the same typography that made the homepage hard. I got the gist — they have portfolio pieces, they've done real projects. The visual thumbnails or project cards helped. I could process those. But the written descriptions underneath? I'd need the same strategies: skim headings, grab bullet points if they exist, skip the rest. I didn't have the energy to read case study after case study. I'd have to come back another day, or use TTS.

**On the About page:** I didn't spend much time there. I knew it would be more of the same — company story, team, values. Prose. I found what I needed from the homepage and Services: they're an AI-centric digital product firm, they do discovery, strategy, design, development, support. That was enough. The About page would have been nice for context, but it wasn't essential for my task. I prioritized efficiency. Get in, get out, don't burn out.

**On the emotional toll:** I want to be clear: this isn't just about convenience. When a site is hard to read, it feels like the site doesn't want me there. It feels like I'm not the intended audience. I'm a designer. I work with clients who care about accessibility. I know what good looks like. I've seen sites that get it right — clear contrast, readable fonts, chunked content. When I encounter LaunchPad Lab, I think: they either don't know, or they don't care. Both are disappointing. I'll probably still reach out. But I'll go in with lower expectations. And I'll wonder, when we talk about their process, whether they've considered users like me.

**Final thoughts:** I completed the task. I know LaunchPad Lab does AI-centric digital product design and development — discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, managed support. I found the contact form via "Connect with an Expert." I could have filled it out. The information was there. But the journey was exhausting. Every typographic choice — the light gray, the thin fonts, the tight spacing, the long paragraphs, the italic testimonials — made it harder. For a firm that builds digital products, this feels like a gap. Fix the typography. Respect your readers. It's not that hard.

**On comparison to other sites:** I've evaluated other agencies. Some are worse — justified text, tiny fonts, no headings at all. LaunchPad Lab isn't the worst. But it's not good. The bar for "acceptable" for me is: can I read the key information without wanting to quit? Can I find the contact path without getting lost? Can I do it in under five minutes without a headache? I did it, but barely. A site that gets it right would feel effortless. I'd leave thinking, "That was easy." I didn't leave thinking that. I left thinking, "I need a break."

**On what "good" would look like:** Dark text. At least #555 or darker. Font weight 400 or 500. Line height 1.6. Paragraphs of two to four sentences max. Bullet points for services. Testimonials in regular font, or one-line pull quotes. A clear "Contact" link in the nav. Phone and email visible on the contact page. That's it. Those changes would have transformed my experience. I would have left feeling respected, not exhausted.

**One last thing:** I'm used to sites not being built for me. I've developed strategies. I skim. I use headings. I zoom. I skip what I can't parse. I got through LaunchPad Lab because I've had years of practice. But a first-time visitor with dyslexia, someone who hasn't built those coping skills, might not make it. They might close the tab. They might never contact the company. That's a loss for everyone. I hope this feedback helps them do better.
