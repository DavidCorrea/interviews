## First-Person Narrative

I opened LaunchPad Lab's site because I'm researching digital product agencies for a nonprofit board project. I'd heard they're AI-focused and based in Chicago—exactly what I need. I'm 61, retired from project management. My vision isn't what it used to be. I don't use a screen magnifier—I find them clunky. Instead, I rely on browser zoom. I keep Chrome at 150% by default. When a site is hard to read, I bump it to 175% or 200%. I sit close to my monitor, maybe 14 inches away. That's how I browse. I expect professional sites—especially from a digital product firm—to work with that.

**I started at 150% zoom.** The hero headline "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development" was large enough that I could read it. That's good. But the body text underneath—the supporting copy—was another story. Thin. Light gray. I had to lean in. The letters didn't have enough weight. They looked like they were fading. I know that look. It's #666 or #777 on white. Designers love it. For me, it's a wall. I could parse the words, but it cost effort. Every sentence required focus. I was already tired before I'd scrolled past the hero.

**The navigation was a mixed bag.** I saw Work, Services, About, and "Connect with an Expert." The nav links themselves—Work, Services, About—felt small. I had to be careful where I clicked. The clickable area around each link didn't feel like 44 pixels. I'm used to that. I take my time. I align the cursor. But it's frustrating. Why make links so small? "Connect with an Expert" was styled as a button, so it had more presence. I figured that was the contact path. I clicked it. It worked. But the nav links beside it? Too tight. Too small. I could have misclicked if I'd been in a hurry.

**I bumped zoom to 175%.** The hero held up. The headline scaled. Good. But when I scrolled to the service boxes—six of them—the text got worse. Each box had a heading and a paragraph. The headings were okay. The paragraphs? Thin font. Light gray. Line height felt tight. The lines ran together. I'd finish a line and my eyes would jump to the wrong one. I had to use my finger to track. At 175% zoom, the text was bigger, but the contrast and weight didn't improve. Bigger blurry text is still blurry. I read the first two service descriptions. By the third, I was straining. I skimmed the rest. I got the gist: discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, support. But I didn't read every word. I couldn't. The typography wouldn't let me.

**The statistics section helped.** "12+ years," "730+ projects," "4.8 rating." Numbers. Short labels. I could process those instantly. No dense paragraphs. No thin gray text. That's what I need. More of that. The award badges were fine—mostly visual. If there was small text on them, I didn't bother. I've learned to skip what I can't read without extreme effort.

**The testimonials were the worst.** Long quote blocks. Italic text. Light gray. At 175% zoom, the italic made the letters even harder to distinguish. The strokes were too fine. "b" and "d" blurred. I tried to read the first testimonial. I gave up halfway. I skipped the rest. I know testimonials matter for credibility. But for me they were walls. I couldn't climb them. I scrolled past.

**I increased to 200% zoom.** This is where it gets interesting. Some sites break. Content overflows. Horizontal scrollbars appear. Headers cover body text. I've seen it all. LaunchPad Lab—mostly it held up. The layout reflowed. I didn't get a horizontal scrollbar on the main content. That's good. But a few things worried me. The fixed header at the top—when I scrolled, did it overlap content? I think it might have. And the service boxes—at 200%, they stacked. That's fine. But the "View project" or "Learn more" links in the case study section? Those felt tiny. Even at 200% zoom, the clickable area was small. I'd have to be precise. One wrong click and I might hit the wrong link. That's exhausting.

**I found the contact form.** I clicked "Connect with an Expert" and landed on the Contact page. First—more testimonials. Five long blocks, stacked above the form. Same problem. Italic. Light gray. I scrolled past them. I wasn't going to read them. I needed the form.

**The form itself was manageable.** Name, email, company, dropdown, message. The labels were there. But the labels—were they light gray too? I think so. I had to focus to read them. The contrast wasn't great. The input fields had placeholders. Placeholders in light gray are a known trap. When you focus the field, does the placeholder disappear? I didn't test that. But if labels and placeholders are both light gray, I'm in trouble. I need clear, dark labels. The submit button—was it big enough? I'd say it was borderline. Maybe 40 pixels tall? I could click it. But it wasn't generous. And the focus indicator—when I tabbed through the form, could I see where I was? I didn't test keyboard nav thoroughly, but I've seen faint focus rings before. If the focus indicator is too light, I lose my place. That's a real problem.

**I had to get closer to the screen.** Even at 200% zoom, the service descriptions and testimonials required me to lean in. Twelve inches. Maybe less. That's not sustainable. I can't sit that close for long. My neck hurts. My eyes fatigue. A site that respects low vision users would give me text I can read at 150% zoom from 18 inches. This site didn't. I had to push zoom to 175–200% and sit at 12–14 inches. That's the only way I could complete the task.

**What worked:** The hero headline was scannable. The statistics were easy. The layout reflowed at zoom—no horizontal scrollbar on the main content. The structure was there—headings, sections. I could navigate. I found what they do: AI-centric digital product design and development, discovery, strategy, UX, prototyping, support. I found the contact form. I could have filled it out. The information was there. The "Connect with an Expert" button was prominent enough.

**What didn't work:** The thin font weight everywhere. The light gray text. The tight line height. The small click targets on nav links and "View project" links. The testimonials—unreadable. The form labels—low contrast. I had to zoom to 175–200% and sit very close. I wouldn't have persisted if I hadn't been doing this evaluation. On a normal day, I might have closed the tab. "I'll contact them later," I'd tell myself. And maybe I wouldn't.

**Would I contact them?** Probably. I found the information. I found the form. But I'd do it grudgingly. A digital product firm that builds accessible experiences—their own site should be readable. If their site is hard for me with browser zoom and a 27-inch monitor, what does that say about the products they build for others? I'm not asking for perfection. I'm asking for 16px body text, minimum. Font weight 500 or better. Contrast that meets 4.5:1, preferably 7:1. Click targets that are 44 pixels. That's baseline. This site didn't meet it.

**Rating: 2 out of 5.** I completed the task. I found what they do and how to contact them. But it cost me. I had to zoom to 175–200%, sit 12–14 inches from the screen, skip the testimonials entirely, and strain through the service descriptions. The typography worked against me. The targets were too small. A 3 would mean it was tolerable. A 2 means I got there, but I'm tired, and I don't feel welcome. A design firm's site should demonstrate their values. This one didn't.

## Additional Reflections

**On zoom and layout:** I'm grateful the layout didn't completely break at 200%. Some sites do. Horizontal scrollbars, overlapping elements, cut-off text. LaunchPad Lab reflowed. That's the minimum. But "didn't break" isn't the same as "worked well." The fixed header might overlap content when scrolled. I'd want to verify that. And the footer—I didn't spend much time there. Were the footer links readable? Were they big enough to click? I'd need to check.

**On font weight:** This is the thing that frustrates me most. Thin fonts are a barrier. Font weight 300 or 400—the strokes are too fine. Letters blur. I need 500 or 600 for comfortable reading. Designers choose thin fonts for aesthetics. I get it. But for users like me, it's hostile. Every paragraph becomes a chore. Fix the font weight. It's one of the lowest-hanging fruits.

**On contrast:** Light gray on white is everywhere. #666, #777, #999. It fails WCAG AA for body text. I need 4.5:1 minimum. I prefer 7:1. Darken the text. #595959 or darker. #404040 for AAA. It's not that hard. And it helps everyone—not just low vision users. Anyone in bright light, anyone tired, anyone with a cheap monitor.

**On click targets:** The nav links, the "View project" links, the footer links—they're too small. 44×44 pixels. That's the minimum. I take extra time to align my cursor. I sometimes use keyboard navigation when mouse precision is difficult. But I shouldn't have to. Make the targets bigger. Add padding. Give me room to click. I'm not asking for huge buttons. I'm asking for enough space to hit what I'm aiming for.

**On getting closer to the screen:** I sit 12–18 inches away. At 150% zoom, the body text on this site was too small. I had to go to 175–200% and lean in to 12–14 inches. That's not sustainable. Text that's readable at 150% from 18 inches would have changed everything. That means 18px body text, minimum. Heavier weight. Better contrast. The site would have felt inclusive instead of exclusive.

**On the contact form:** I could fill it out. The fields were labeled. But the labels could have been bolder, darker. The submit button could have been larger. And the testimonials above the form—why? I came to contact them. I didn't come to read five long quotes first. Put the form first. Let me do my task. Then show me testimonials if you want.

**On whether I'd recommend the site:** I'd tell a low vision colleague: "You can get the info, but bring your zoom and your patience." The content is there. The layout holds up at zoom. But the typography and targets work against you. For an agency that does digital product work, it feels like a missed opportunity. They could demonstrate inclusive design right here. Instead, it feels like they designed for aesthetics first.

**On the case study section:** I glanced at the Work section. Project cards. "View project" links. Those links—small. Even at 200% zoom, the clickable area felt tight. I'd have to be careful. One slip and I might open the wrong project. The project titles and descriptions? Same typography as the rest of the site. Thin. Gray. I skimmed. I didn't read every word. I got the idea—they've done real work for real clients. But the details? I'd need to zoom more, sit closer, or skip. I chose to skip.

**On the footer:** I didn't spend much time there. Footer links are often the smallest on the page. I'd want to verify: Are they readable? Are they 44 pixels? Can I click them without misclicking? From what I saw of the rest of the site, I'd guess they have the same problems. Light gray. Thin. Small targets. If I needed to find a phone number or email, I'd have to work for it.

**On fatigue:** After ten minutes on this site, I felt it. My eyes were tired. My neck was stiff from leaning in. I took a break. Closed the tab. Came back to finish the evaluation. On a normal day, when I'm researching agencies for my board project, I might have given up after the service section. "I'll contact them later," I'd tell myself. And maybe I wouldn't. That's a loss for them and for me.

**On what would have helped:** Bigger text. Heavier fonts. Darker text. Bigger click targets. Put the contact form first on the Contact page—before the testimonials. Make "Contact" visible in the nav, not just "Connect with an Expert." Those changes would have transformed my experience. I would have left feeling respected, not exhausted.

**On the emotional toll:** When a site is hard to read, it feels like the site doesn't want me there. I'm 61. I've spent decades adapting. I use zoom. I sit close. I take my time. I've developed strategies. But I shouldn't have to fight the design. A digital product firm—one that builds experiences for clients—should know that users like me exist. We're not edge cases. We're a significant part of the population. Age-related vision changes are common. If their own site doesn't accommodate us, what does that say about the products they build?

**On comparison to other sites:** I've looked at other agencies. Some are worse—fixed layouts that break at 150% zoom, text that doesn't scale at all. LaunchPad Lab isn't the worst. The layout reflows. That matters. But it's not good enough. The bar for "acceptable" for me is: can I read the key information at 150% zoom from 18 inches? Can I click the links without misclicking? Can I do it without leaning in and straining? I couldn't. I had to push to 175–200% and sit at 12–14 inches. A site that gets it right would feel effortless. I'd leave thinking, "That was easy." I didn't leave thinking that.

**On what "good" would look like:** Body text at 18px, font weight 500, color #404040 or darker. Line height 1.6. Nav links and buttons with 44px minimum touch targets. Contact form above testimonials. Clear "Contact" in the nav. Focus indicators I can actually see. That's it. Those changes would have transformed my experience. I would have left feeling included, not excluded. I wouldn't have needed to zoom past 150% or sit 12 inches from the screen.

**Final thoughts:** I completed the task. I know LaunchPad Lab does AI-centric digital product design and development. I found the contact form via "Connect with an Expert." I could have filled it out. But the journey was exhausting. Every typographic choice—the thin fonts, the light gray, the tight spacing, the small targets—made it harder. Fix the basics. Respect users who rely on zoom. It's not that hard.
