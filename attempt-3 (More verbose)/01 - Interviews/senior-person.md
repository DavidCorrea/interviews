## First-Person Narrative

I am Eleanor. I am seventy-four years old. I live in the Chicago suburbs. I retired from school administration fifteen years ago. I have used computers for decades—email, browsing, online banking. But the web has changed. My grandson mentioned Launchpad Lab. He said they are a tech company in Chicago that builds websites and apps. I am helping a small nonprofit look for a firm to redesign their website. I need to understand what they do and how to get in touch. I would rather call them than fill out a form. I hope the website is clear and not too flashy. I get confused when there are too many buttons and links. I will tell you what happened when I visited.

**I opened the homepage and read slowly, top to bottom.** That is how I read. I do not skim. I need time to understand each section. The first thing I saw was a big headline: "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." I paused. What does that mean? AI I know—artificial intelligence. But "AI-centric"? Is that the same as "focused on AI"? Why not say it plainly? "Digital product design and development"—what does that mean? Do they build websites? Do they build phone apps? Both? I could not tell. The words sound impressive but they do not tell me what they actually do. I wanted one clear sentence: "We build websites and apps for businesses." That would have answered my question in five seconds. Instead I had to keep reading.

**The text was too small and too light.** I wear reading glasses. I sometimes increase the browser zoom. The body text under the headline was thin and gray. I had to lean in. I had to squint. Light gray on white—that has always been hard for me. My eyes are not what they used to be. I need larger text and darker text. Eighteen pixels or more for body text. Strong contrast. This site did not give me that. Every paragraph required effort. I read the first few sentences. By the time I reached the service section, I was already tired.

**The navigation confused me.** I looked for "Contact." Every website I have ever used has a Contact link. That is what I look for. I saw Work, Services, About, and "Connect with an Expert." Work and Services and About—I understand those. But "Connect with an Expert"? Is that the same as Contact? I paused. I wondered: Why do they not just say "Contact"? Connect with an expert—connect with whom? An expert from their company? Is that how I reach them? I was not certain. I had to guess. I clicked it to find out. It took me to the Contact page. So yes, it is Contact. But why make me guess? "Contact" says exactly what will happen. "Connect with an Expert" sounds like marketing. I distrust that. I want straightforward labels. I expect websites to work like they did years ago. Contact was Contact. Now I have to decode.

**The six service boxes overwhelmed me.** Six boxes. Six different things. Each one had a heading and a paragraph. I read the first one slowly. Something about AI automation. Agentic AI. Agentic—I have never heard that word. I moved to the next. Bespoke. Discovery process. Cross-functional. Seamless handoff. Proof of concept. The words piled up. I could not hold them all. Which one do I click? What do they actually do? I read methodically. I did not rush. But by the time I finished the sixth box, I was confused. I knew they do something with websites, apps, AI, and strategy. I could not explain it simply to someone else. There were too many options. I wanted a clear path. I got a maze.

**The statistics and badges did not help much.** Twelve years, seven hundred thirty projects, four point eight rating. Numbers. I could read those. But do they tell me what the company does? Not really. They tell me they have been around a while and have done a lot of work. The award badges—I glanced at them. They looked like marketing. I focus on substantive content. I am skeptical of flashy elements. I moved on.

**The testimonials made things worse.** Long quote blocks. Italic text. Light gray. I tried to read the first one. The letters were hard to distinguish. The strokes were too fine. I gave up. I scrolled past. I know testimonials are supposed to build trust. But when the text is hard to read and the language is full of jargon, they do not help me. They feel like sales pitches. I distrust that. I wanted facts. I wanted to know what they do and how to contact them. The testimonials did not answer either question.

**I looked for a phone number and email.** I prefer to call or send an email. Web forms feel impersonal. I worry about whether my message was received. I want to see a phone number and email address clearly displayed. I scrolled to the footer. I think the contact information was there. But it was not obvious. It was not prominent. I had to look for it. If I had not been doing this evaluation, I might have missed it. Someone who prefers to call should not have to hunt.

**I clicked "Connect with an Expert" to reach the Contact page.** The first thing I saw was more testimonials. Five long quote blocks. One after another. I had to scroll past all of them to reach the form. Why are testimonials above the form? I came to contact them. I did not come to read five more quotes. I scrolled. I scrolled. Finally I saw the form. I was frustrated. Put the form first. Let me do my task. Then show me testimonials if you want. Making me wade through marketing copy before I can contact them—that is disrespectful of my time.

**The contact form had too many fields.** Name, email, company, a dropdown, message. The dropdown—what does it ask? Project type? How I heard about them? The label was not clear. I would rather call. I would rather send an email. A form with many fields feels like a barrier. If I must use a form, it should be simple. Clear labels. Fewer choices. This form was not simple. I could fill it out. But I would prefer not to.

**What worked:** The page structure was okay. I could use headings to understand where I was. The navigation was consistent. I did not get lost. I could always go back. The layout was linear. I like that. I do not like overlapping sections or unconventional designs. This site was mostly straightforward. I found what they do—they build websites and apps, they work with AI, they do strategy and design. I found how to contact them—the form, and I think phone and email in the footer. I completed my task.

**What did not work:** "Connect with an Expert" instead of "Contact"—I had to guess. The text was too small and too light. I had to lean in and squint. The jargon—AI-centric, digital product design, development firm, bespoke, agentic, discovery process—did not tell me plainly what they do. Six service boxes felt like too many. The testimonials above the form made me scroll before I could contact. No phone number or email prominently displayed. I prefer direct communication. The form had many fields and an unclear dropdown. The whole experience felt like it was designed for someone younger, someone who skims, someone who trusts marketing language. It was not designed for me.

**Would I contact them?** Yes, I think so. I found the information. I could call or email if I can find the number. I could fill out the form if I must. But I would do it with some reluctance. The confusion with the labels, the small text, the jargon, the testimonials in the way—it all made me feel like an afterthought. A company that wants to work with nonprofits, with organizations that might have older volunteers like me on their boards—they should make their website clear and respectful. This one was not.

**Rating: 2 out of 5.** I completed the task. I found what they do and how to contact them. But it cost me. The unconventional labels, the small text, the jargon, the testimonials above the form, the preference for forms over phone and email—all of it created barriers. A 3 would mean it was acceptable. A 2 means I got there, but I am tired, and I do not feel welcome. I am seventy-four. I have used the web for decades. I am capable. I am independent. I expect websites to be straightforward. This one was not. I hope this feedback helps.

## Additional Reflections

**On "Connect with an Expert":** Every website I know has "Contact" or "Contact Us." That is what I look for. When I see "Connect with an Expert," I pause. I wonder: Is that the same thing? Why the different words? It feels like marketing. I distrust that. Just say "Contact." Be clear. Be conventional. Respect that some of us learned the web when labels were simple.

**On jargon:** "AI-centric," "digital product design," "development firm"—what do these mean in plain English? I want: "We build websites and apps for businesses. We help you add AI to your products." One sentence. Clear. No decoding required. The industry terms sound impressive but they exclude people like me. I am helping a nonprofit. I am not a tech person. I need to understand quickly. I cannot spend twenty minutes piecing it together from six service boxes.

**On phone and email:** I prefer to pick up the phone. I prefer to send an email. I want to know my message was received. Web forms feel uncertain. If you must have a form, make it simple. And put the phone number and email where I can see them. Not buried in the footer. Not hidden. Prominent. I should not have to hunt.

**On testimonials above the form:** I came to the Contact page to contact them. The first thing I saw was five long testimonials. I had to scroll past all of them. That is wrong. Put the form first. Put testimonials below. Or on a different page. Do not make me wade through marketing to do my task. That is disrespectful.

**On small text and low contrast:** My vision has declined. That is normal at seventy-four. I need larger text. I need darker text. Light gray on white is a barrier. I squint. I lean in. I increase zoom. I should not have to. A site that respects older users would give me text I can read without strain. This one did not.

**On too many choices:** Six service boxes. Multiple "Learn more" links. Several call-to-action buttons. It overwhelms me. I need a clear path. I read methodically. I do not jump around. When there are too many options, I get confused. Which one do I click? Simplify. Give me fewer choices. Make the path obvious.

**On what would have helped:** One clear sentence at the top: "We build websites and mobile apps for businesses. We help you add AI to your products. Contact us to discuss your project." "Contact" in the navigation, not "Connect with an Expert." The contact form first on the Contact page, with testimonials below. Phone number and email prominently displayed. Larger text. Darker text. Plain language. That would have transformed my experience.

**On the case studies:** I glanced at the Work section. Project cards with names I did not recognize. "View project" links. I did not click them. I had already spent too much time. The project descriptions used the same abstract language—transformative, scalable, operational efficiency. I wanted concrete examples: "We built a website for X that helped them do Y." I did not get that. I moved on.

**On recommending the site:** Would I tell another volunteer at the nonprofit to use this site? I would say: "You can find the information, but it takes patience. Look for 'Connect with an Expert'—that is their Contact page. The text is small, so zoom in. Scroll past the testimonials to reach the form. Or look for their phone number in the footer." That is not a strong recommendation. A site that works for people my age would not need those instructions.

**On the form dropdown:** The contact form had a dropdown. I did not know what it was for. Project type? Budget? How I heard about them? The label was not visible or clear. When labels are unclear, I worry about choosing the wrong option. I might leave a field blank. I might abandon the form. Clear labels matter. Especially for someone who prefers to call—if the form is my only option, it had better be simple.

**On the emotional toll:** When a site uses words I do not understand, when the labels are unfamiliar, when I have to scroll past marketing to do my task—it feels like the site was not designed for me. I am seventy-four. I have used the web for decades. I am capable. I am independent. I expect to be respected. This site did not feel respectful. It felt like it was designed for someone younger, someone who skims, someone who trusts flashy language. I hope this feedback helps them do better.

**On what "accessible" means for me:** When people talk about accessibility, they often mean screen readers and keyboard navigation. Those matter. But for me, accessibility also means: Can I read the text without straining? Can I find "Contact" without guessing? Can I reach the form without scrolling through five testimonials? Can I call or email instead of filling out a form? Language, labels, and layout—they are accessibility issues too. If the site is not designed for someone like me, I am excluded.

**On trust:** When a company cannot explain itself in plain language, when their contact path is hidden behind marketing phrases, when they make me work to find a phone number—I wonder: Will they understand my needs? Will they communicate clearly when we work together? The confusion on the site made me less confident. I would still reach out for the nonprofit. But I would go in with lower expectations.

**Final thoughts:** I completed my task. I know Launchpad Lab builds websites and apps. I found how to contact them. But the journey was frustrating. The labels, the text, the jargon, the testimonials, the form—none of it felt designed for someone like me. I am not an edge case. There are millions of us. Older users. Slower readers. People who prefer phone and email. People who expect "Contact" to say "Contact." We deserve better.
