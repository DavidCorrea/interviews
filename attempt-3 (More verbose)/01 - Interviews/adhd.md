## First-Person Narrative

Okay, so I pulled up LaunchPad Lab because I need to vet agencies for a project we're kicking off. I'm a marketing manager—I do this all the time. But here's the thing: my brain does not cooperate with websites that make me work for it. I've got ADHD, combined type. I need to get in, get answers, get out. Fast. Every extra second feels like a tax.

**First impressions? Chaos.** The page loaded and I swear everything moved at once. Or maybe it was just me—my eyes bouncing. The hero headline said "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." I caught that. Good. But then my attention went *right* to the client logos. Harvard. Northwestern. Whirlpool. Oh, they work with big names. Cool. Then I noticed something animating—cards fading in as I scrolled? Or maybe it was the logos sliding? I honestly couldn't tell you. I just know I was watching motion instead of reading. I had to physically tell myself, "Jordan, focus. What do they *do*?"

I scanned the hero again. "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." Okay, so they build digital products. Apps? Websites? Something with AI. I got the gist in maybe two seconds. But then I scrolled and—boom—six service boxes. Six. I froze. Literally. My cursor hovered over the first one. Then the second. I couldn't decide which to click. "AI Automation," "Web Apps," "Agentic AI," "Bespoke Solutions"—what's the difference? Which one tells me what they do? I didn't read any of them. I just saw six boxes and thought, *I'm not doing this.* I scrolled past. Decision paralysis. Classic.

**The statistics actually helped.** "12+ Years." "730+ Projects." "4.8 rating." Numbers. Short. I processed those instantly. That's what my brain likes. Not paragraphs. Not six choices. Numbers and bullets. Give me that.

**Then the award badges.** Seven of them. Maybe more. I didn't count. I just thought, *Why are there so many things?* My eyes glazed. I scrolled faster. I wasn't reading anymore. I was fleeing. Too much visual noise. Logos, boxes, stats, badges—all competing. I didn't know where to look. I wanted to leave. I almost did.

**Finding what they do:** I eventually pieced it together from the hero and a quick glance at the nav. "Services" — probably tells me what they offer. "Work" — probably their portfolio. I didn't click either. I'd already spent like 30 seconds and I was losing steam. The hero said enough: digital product design and development, AI-focused. Good. Done. I moved on. I didn't need to read six service descriptions. I needed one sentence. I got it. Barely.

**Finding contact info:** This is where I got *frustrated*. I looked at the nav. "Work, Services, About, Connect with an Expert." "Connect with an Expert" — is that contact? I think so. I didn't see "Contact" anywhere. Why not just say "Contact"? I clicked it. Impulsive. First prominent thing. Didn't compare. Didn't deliberate. Just clicked.

I landed on the Contact page. And then—oh my god. **Five or six long testimonials.** Stacked. One after another. Above the form. I was like, *Where is the form?* I scrolled. More testimonials. I scrolled again. Still testimonials. "I had to scroll past *all* of them," I told my colleague later. "I came to contact them. I didn't come to read five paragraphs of praise." It felt like the site was punishing me. I was already impatient. This made it worse. I almost closed the tab. "Forget it, I'll email someone directly." But I didn't have an email. So I kept scrolling. Finally—the form. Name, email, company, dropdown, message. I could work with that. But I was annoyed. The testimonials didn't motivate me. They delayed me. They distracted me. I had to fight through them to do the thing I came to do.

**No skip links.** I didn't even think about it until afterward. A "Skip to main content" or "Skip to contact form" would have been a lifesaver. I would have clicked it in a heartbeat. Instead I had to scroll through the entire homepage, then scroll through all those testimonials. Every scroll felt like wasted effort. My brain was screaming, *Get me to the form.*

**Animations on scroll.** Yeah, those got me. Cards fading in, things moving—I'd be trying to read a heading and something would animate and my eyes would snap to it. I'd forget what I was reading. I had to re-scan. It happened at least twice. Motion wins. Content loses. That's just how my brain works. I can't not look.

**The jargon.** "Agentic AI." "Bespoke." "Cross-functional." "Discovery process." I skimmed those words. I didn't absorb them. Dense text = instant skip. I wanted bullets. One-line summaries. "We build websites and apps." Done. Instead I got paragraphs. I didn't read them. I scanned the first line of each service box and moved on. If the answer wasn't in the first line, I wasn't going to find it.

**Competing CTAs.** "Connect with an Expert" in the nav. "Learn More" on like six things. "Get Started" somewhere? I didn't know which button got me to a human. I clicked the biggest one. Hope and pray. It worked—it went to the contact page. But I shouldn't have had to guess.

## Numbered Pain Points

1. **No skip links** — Had to scroll through the entire homepage and all testimonials to reach the contact form. No way to jump. Felt like a slog.

2. **Animations on scroll** — Cards and elements fading/sliding in pulled my attention away from content. I'd lose my place. Motion hijacked my focus.

3. **Six service boxes** — Decision paralysis. Too many choices. I froze, then scrolled past without engaging. Couldn't decide which to click.

4. **Seven+ award badges** — Visual clutter. Added to cognitive overload. Eyes glazed. Didn't process them.

5. **Testimonials above the contact form** — Had to scroll past 5–6 long quotes before reaching the form. Came to contact, not to read testimonials. Frustrating delay.

6. **Dense text and jargon** — Paragraphs too long. "Agentic AI," "bespoke," "cross-functional"—skipped. Wanted bullets and one-line summaries.

7. **Many competing CTAs** — "Connect with an Expert," "Learn More," "Get Started"—unclear which led to contact. Clicked the biggest one impulsively.

8. **Client logos and stats competing for attention** — Logos (Harvard, Northwestern, Whirlpool) and statistics pulled my eyes before I'd processed the hero. Distraction before comprehension.

9. **Unclear nav label** — "Connect with an Expert" instead of "Contact." Had to infer. Extra cognitive step.

10. **Form buried below fold on Contact page** — Form wasn't visible on load. Had to scroll past testimonials. Primary action delayed.

## What Worked Well

- **Hero headline was scannable** — "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development" answered "what do you do?" in one line. I got it without reading paragraphs.

- **Statistics stuck** — "12+ Years," "730+ Projects," "4.8 rating." Numbers and short labels. My brain processed those instantly.

- **Consistent navigation** — Same nav on every page. I could reorient when I got lost. That helped.

- **"Connect with an Expert" led to contact** — Even though the label was unclear, clicking it got me where I needed to go. Better than a dead end.

- **Form fields were labeled** — Name, email, company, dropdown, message. Clear. I could fill it out without decoding.

- **Professional design** — Looked legit. I trusted it was a real company. Didn't worry about scams.

- **Flat structure** — Didn't have to dig through multiple levels. Work, Services, About, Contact. Manageable.

## Overall Rating: 2.5 / 5

I completed both goals. I know what they do—digital product design and development, AI-focused. I found the contact form. But it shouldn't have been this hard. The animations distracted me. The six service boxes paralyzed me. The testimonials above the form made me want to leave. No skip links meant endless scrolling. I got there, but I was tired and annoyed. A 3 would mean it was tolerable. A 2 would mean I nearly gave up. I'm in between. I made it, but I don't feel welcome.

## Summary

Jordan Rivera (32, marketing manager, ADHD combined type) visited LaunchPad Lab to find what the company does and how to contact them. They completed both tasks but experienced significant friction. Key ADHD-specific issues: scanning instead of reading (skipped dense text and jargon); decision paralysis when facing six service boxes; impulsive clicking on "Connect with an Expert" without comparing options; distraction from client logos, award badges, and scroll-triggered animations; frustration with contact form buried below 5–6 long testimonials; no skip links to bypass scrolling. What helped: scannable hero headline, statistics (numbers processed quickly), consistent nav, labeled form fields. Recommend: add skip links, reduce/group service choices, move contact form above testimonials, reduce or allow disabling of scroll animations, use plain "Contact" in nav, reduce visual clutter and competing CTAs.
