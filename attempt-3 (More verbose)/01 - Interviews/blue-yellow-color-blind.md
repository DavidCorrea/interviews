# Interview: Marcus Chen (Blue-Yellow Color Blind Persona / Tritanomaly)

**Date:** February 16, 2025  
**Website:** https://launchpadlab.com/  
**Task:** Find what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them  
**Persona:** Marcus Chen, 38, product manager with tritanomaly — blues appear greenish/gray, yellows appear white or light gray

## First Impressions

I landed on the LaunchPad Lab homepage and my first thought was: *"Okay, another agency site. Let's see what they're hiding behind color."* I've got tritanomaly—blues look dull and greenish to me, yellows and light blues wash out to white or very light gray. I discovered it in my twenties during a routine eye exam. I've learned to compensate, but I'm always scanning for the moment the design assumes I can see what everyone else sees.

The headline was clear: "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." Good—that's text. I didn't need color to understand it. But I was already looking for trouble: links, buttons, badges, any CTAs. If they're styled in blue, they might look like gray or green to me—barely distinguishable from body text. If they use yellow or gold for awards or CTAs, those could vanish into the background entirely.

> *"Blue is supposed to be the 'accessible' color for links. Not for me. Blue looks greenish. Gray. I need underlines. I need something that isn't hue."*

The overall layout was clean. Professional. But clean doesn't mean I can see it. I had to work to find what was clickable.

## What I Could and Couldn't Perceive

**Links:** I looked at the navigation—Work, Services, About, Contact, "Connect with an Expert." Were they underlined? If they're only blue, they'd read as gray or greenish-gray to me. I rely on position and labels. I tabbed through to confirm what was focusable. Without underlines or icons, I can't tell at a glance what's a link and what's just bold text. I've learned to hover and watch for *something* to change—underline, background, border. If the only change is a subtle color shift, I might miss it.

**The "Connect with an Expert" CTA:** This is supposed to be the main call-to-action. If it's a blue or yellow button, it might blend. Blue looks dull to me. Yellow looks white. I need a border, a shadow, or a label that stands out by weight or size—not by color. I found it by position and text. But if it had been a subtle yellow accent on a light background, I might have skimmed right past it.

**Service boxes and icons:** The homepage has six service areas. If they're differentiated by blue, yellow, or green accents, I can't tell them apart. Blues and greens blur. Yellows disappear. I looked for icons—shapes, not colors—and headings. The text did the work. But any "obvious" color coding was lost on me.

**Statistics and badges:** 12+ Years, 730+ Projects, 4.8 rating. Award badges. If those badges are gold or yellow—prestige colors—they'd look white or very light gray to me. I might not perceive them as awards at all. Just faint shapes. The numbers themselves were large and bold. That helped.

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

**Homepage:** The main headline told me: AI-centric digital product design and development. Text-based. I didn't need color. I scrolled. Client logos—Harvard, Northwestern, others. Logos often use brand colors. Some were faded. I couldn't always make out the names. I got the gist: they work with big organizations.

**Services:** I clicked Services in the nav. The page title said "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." I read the headings and descriptions. Web apps, mobile apps, Salesforce, AI automation, design, support. The structure was clear. If the service cards used blue, yellow, or green as the only differentiator, I'd have been stuck. I relied on icons and text. Icons help—as long as they're not color-coded. Blue icons on blue backgrounds? Invisible.

**About:** "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Founded 2012. Digital product design and development. The content was text-driven. I skimmed. I understood. No color-coded timeline or diagram that would have blocked me.

> *"The copy carried me. I understood they do AI automation, web and mobile development, UX/UI design. But I was always watching for the moment color would fail me. Awards, badges, status indicators—those are where it usually breaks."*

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

**Navigation:** I looked for Contact. It was in the main nav. I found it by label and position. If the link had been styled only in blue with no underline, I might have missed it—blue reads as gray to me. I clicked.

**Contact page:** Testimonials first. Long quotes. I scrolled. I was looking for a form, a phone number, an email. When I found the form, I braced myself. Forms are where color dependency hurts the most.

**Form validation:** This is my biggest fear. If the form uses red borders for errors and green for success—with no icon or text—I'm sunk. Red can look brownish or muted to me. Green can look bluish. And if they use *only* color, I can't tell which field failed or whether my submission worked. I need an error icon (✗ or !) and clear text: "Please enter a valid email." I need a success message: "Your message has been sent" with a checkmark. Color alone is useless.

**Required fields:** If they use a red asterisk only, I might not see it. Red blends. I need "Required" in text or an icon. I didn't fill out the form in this test, but I'd be nervous. I've left forms before when I couldn't tell if I'd succeeded or which field had an error.

**Footer:** I'd check for phone and email. If they're in small, light gray text—#666, #777—they'd be hard to read. My color confusion compounds with low contrast. Light gray on white is already tough; add blue or yellow tints and it gets worse.

> *"Contact was findable. The structure worked. But the form—that's the real test. If validation is color-only, I can't complete it confidently. For a firm that builds digital products, I'd expect them to know better."*

## Pain Points (Blue-Yellow Specific)

1. **Links in blue only:** Blue looks greenish or gray to me. No underline, no icon—I can't tell it's a link. I rely on hover, tab, or guessing.

2. **Yellow or gold accents:** Awards, badges, CTAs in yellow or gold—they look white or very light gray. They vanish. I might not perceive prestige or emphasis at all.

3. **Blue focus indicators:** If the focus ring is a subtle blue outline, it may be weak for me. I need a strong outline—2px, dark—in a color I can see. Black works. Blue can fade.

4. **Form validation (red/green):** Red borders for errors may look brown or gray. Green for success may look similar. Without icons and text, I'm blocked.

5. **Service cards with blue/yellow/green accents:** If the only way to tell sections apart is color, I can't. I need icons, headings, borders.

6. **Hover states that only change color:** Blue to darker blue, yellow to gold—I might not see it. I need underline, border, or shadow.

7. **Light gray text with blue or yellow tints:** #666–#777 is already low contrast. Add a blue or yellow cast and it gets harder. Body text needs to be dark and clear.

## What Worked Well

- **Clear headings and structure:** H1, H2, H3 hierarchy. I could scan by heading. I didn't need color to understand the layout.

- **Descriptive labels:** "Services," "Work," "About," "Contact," "Connect with an Expert"—self-explanatory. I found them by text and position.

- **Text-first value proposition:** The main message was in the headline, not in a color-coded graphic. That's how it should be.

- **Statistics in large, bold numbers:** 12+ Years, 730+ Projects. Readable. Not dependent on color.

- **Logical navigation:** Standard pattern. Contact visible. I could complete the task by following labels and structure.

- **Icons in service sections:** When icons had distinct shapes (not just color), they helped. I could differentiate services by icon + text.

> *"The structure is solid. Headings, labels, text—those carried me through. But I'm a product manager. I evaluate vendors. When I see color-only cues, I note it. For a digital product firm, I expect better. Underlines on links. Icons and text for form validation. Non-color differentiation. That's baseline."*

## Overall Rating

**3 out of 5**

I completed both tasks. I understood what they do—AI-focused digital product design and development, web and mobile apps, Salesforce, strategy. I found the Contact page and the form. But I was constantly on guard. I couldn't assume links were visible. I couldn't assume the "Connect with an Expert" button would stand out. I couldn't trust that form validation would work for me. The awards and badges—if they're gold or yellow—I may have missed their impact entirely. The experience would be significantly better with underlines on links, icons and text for form validation, and non-color cues for all critical UI elements.

## Summary

Marcus Chen (tritanomaly) successfully completed the task of finding what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them. He relied on headings, labels, and text structure—not color. Links styled only in blue were hard to distinguish from body text. Yellow or gold accents (awards, badges, CTAs) may have been imperceptible. Form validation that relies on red/green borders without icons or text would block confident form completion. The site's content structure is strong, but color-dependent design creates barriers for users with blue-yellow color vision deficiency. Implementing underlines on links, icons and text for validation states, and non-color differentiation for buttons and status indicators would substantially improve accessibility and align with WCAG 1.4.1 (Use of Color).
