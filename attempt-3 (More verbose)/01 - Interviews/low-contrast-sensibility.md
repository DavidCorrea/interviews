## First-Person Narrative

I opened the LaunchPad Lab site because I'm researching digital product agencies for a software project at my nonprofit. I'd heard they're AI-centric—design and development in Chicago. Perfect fit. But I knew what I'd be up against. I've learned the hard way: most websites are built for people whose eyes don't struggle with contrast. Mine do. I'm 52. My contrast sensitivity has changed. Text that looks "fine" to others blurs, shimmers, or disappears for me. I came in ready to judge. If a design firm can't make their own site readable, what does that say about the products they build?

**The hero section hit me first.** "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." The headline itself—I could make it out. It's large enough, dark enough. But the supporting text underneath? Light gray. #666, #777, somewhere in that range. On white. I've seen this a thousand times. Designers love it. "Elegant," they say. "Subtle." For me, it's hostile. The letters don't pop. They blend into the background. I had to lean in. Squint. I could parse it, but every word cost effort. And I hadn't even started.

**I looked for the contact path immediately.** That's my strategy. Find the goal first, then work backward. I scanned the navigation: Work, Services, About, and something that said "Connect with an Expert." But here's the problem—were those links? I couldn't tell. There were no underlines. No bold. Just text. Same color family as everything else. I hovered. I tabbed. Did an underline appear? I'm not sure I saw one clearly. If the only difference between a link and plain text is a slight color shift—a darker gray, a blue tint—I cannot distinguish them. My eyes don't pick that up. I had to guess. "Connect with an Expert" sounded like the contact CTA. I hoped I was right.

**The body text was a wall of strain.** I scrolled to the services section. Six boxes. Each one had a description—paragraphs of copy. And every paragraph was that same light gray. #666, #777. On white. I tried to read the first one. "Discovery & Strategy" or something like that. The letters lost their edges. They blended. I know from experience: this is the exact range that causes me the most trouble. What others read effortlessly requires sustained effort from me. I could extract the gist—they do discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, managed support. I got that from the headings and the first few words of each block. But the full paragraphs? I skimmed. I skipped. My eyes were already fatiguing. After two minutes of this, I felt the familiar strain. The desire to close the tab. I pushed through because I was evaluating. A real visitor might have left.

**The font weight made it worse.** The text wasn't just light in color—it was thin. 300, maybe 400. Thin fonts are nearly impossible for me. Letters lose their definition. They vanish into the background. I need medium (500) or at least regular (400) weight. Bold (600) for headings. This site gave me neither. The body text felt like it was dissolving. Elegant, thin typography is a barrier. It's not a design choice—it's a wall.

**The statistics section was a relief.** "12+ Years," "730+ Projects," "4.8" rating. Numbers. Short labels. If those had been in light gray too, they would have been useless. I didn't stop to measure. But they stood out enough that I could read them. That's what I need. High-contrast elements. Bold numbers. Clear labels. More of that, please.

**The testimonials were the worst.** Long quote blocks. Italic text. And—I'm almost certain—the same light gray. Italic plus light gray is a double barrier. The letters distort. They wash out. I tried to read the first testimonial: something about "everybody here has been really impressed." I gave up after two lines. I couldn't sustain it. I scrolled past all of them. I know testimonials matter for credibility. But for me they were invisible. I may never read them. That's the reality.

**Links without underlines—I can't find them.** Throughout the site, I encountered text that might have been links. "Learn more." "View project." Case study titles. In-content links. Were they underlined? Bold? I don't think so. If the only cue is color, I miss them. I rely on underlines, bold, or icons. Color-only differentiation fails me. I may have scrolled past half the links on the page without knowing they were there. That's not acceptable. A professional site—especially from a design and development firm—should know that.

**The "Connect with an Expert" CTA.** I found it. I clicked it. But did it stand out? Would I have noticed it if I hadn't been looking? I'm not sure. Low-contrast buttons—light gray on white, pale blue on white—do not register as interactive for me. They blend. I may scroll past them. I need strong borders, bold text, or high-contrast backgrounds. This CTA—I think it had some visual weight. But it wasn't obvious. It wasn't the beacon it should be.

**The contact page: more testimonials, then the form.** I landed on the Contact page. Five testimonial blocks stacked above the form. Same problem. Long, italic, light gray. I scrolled past them. I wasn't going to read them. I needed the form.

**The form itself—labels and placeholders.** Name, email, company, dropdown, message. The labels—were they dark and bold? Or light gray? I had to focus. I think they were readable, but barely. If they'd been in #999 or lighter, I would have struggled. Placeholder text in light gray is often invisible to me. I need dark, bold labels. The submit button—did it stand out? I hope so. Low-contrast submit buttons are a common failure. I've filled out forms and then spent thirty seconds hunting for the submit button because it blended with the background. I didn't have that experience here, but I was alert. I was looking. A fatigued user might miss it.

**The award badges.** Seven or more. If there was text on or near them—captions, labels—I didn't read it. Secondary content in light gray is often the lowest contrast on the page. I skip it. I've learned to. "Powered by" text, footnotes, captions—they're usually invisible. I flag them all. They matter to someone. Just not to me, the way they're designed.

**What I found:** LaunchPad Lab does AI-centric digital product design and development. Discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, managed support. I found the contact form via "Connect with an Expert." I could have filled it out. The information was there. I completed the task.

**What it cost me:** Strain. Fatigue. Uncertainty. Every paragraph of light gray text was a test of endurance. Every link without an underline was a guess. Every thin font was a barrier. I would not have persisted if I hadn't been doing this evaluation. A real visitor—someone like me, researching agencies—might have closed the tab after the services section. "I'll come back later," they'd say. And maybe they wouldn't.

**Rating: 2 out of 5.** I completed the task. I found what they do and how to contact them. But the experience was punishing. The body text in #666–#777 on white—the exact range that fails me—was everywhere. Links were indistinguishable without underlines. Thin fonts made the text vanish. The testimonials were unreadable. The CTAs were not as visible as they should be. A 3 would mean it was tolerable. A 1 would mean I gave up. I'm at 2. I got there. But I felt dismissed. I felt like the designer forgot I exist. For a firm that builds digital products, that's a gap. Fix the contrast. Add underlines to links. Increase font weight. It's not that hard.

## Additional Reflections

**On the light gray:** This is the thing that frustrates me most. #666, #777 on white. Designers use it everywhere. They think it looks refined. For me, it's hostile. The letters don't pop. They blend. When I'm tired, they disappear. I've used browser extensions to force darker text. It helps. But I shouldn't have to. A digital product firm should know that this palette fails low-contrast users. It's not just me. It's anyone over 50, anyone in bright light, anyone with reduced contrast sensitivity. The fix is simple: darker text. #595959 minimum for AA. #404040 for AAA. That would transform my experience.

**On links:** I cannot overstate this. If links are differentiated only by color, I cannot find them. I hover randomly. I tab through. I miss links entirely. "Connect with an Expert" may look like plain text. In-content links—"Learn more," "View project"—may be invisible. The fix: underlines. Or bold. Or icons. Something that isn't color. Every professional site should do this. It's WCAG. It's basic.

**On thin fonts:** Font weight 300 or lighter is illegible for me. Letters lose their edges. They blend into the background. I need 400 minimum. 500 is better. Bold for headings. This site used thin typography throughout. It's a barrier. It's not elegant—it's exclusionary.

**On fatigue:** After two or three minutes of reading low-contrast content, my comprehension drops. I want to leave. I noted where I would have abandoned: right after the services section. The testimonials would have been the final straw. I pushed through for this evaluation. A real user might not.

**On what would have helped:** Dark text. Underlined links. Heavier font weight. High-contrast buttons. Bold labels on the form. Fewer testimonials in light gray italic—or at least regular font weight and darker color. Statistics that pop. Navigation that's obviously interactive. That's it. Those changes would have made me feel included instead of dismissed.

**On whether I'd contact them:** Probably. I found the form. I know what they do. But I'd go in with lower expectations. If their own site doesn't respect contrast, will their products? I'll ask. I'll be vocal. I always am. I hope this feedback helps.

**On zoom:** I often browse at 125–150% when sites are hard to read. I didn't test it on LaunchPad Lab for this evaluation, but I suspect it would help—bigger text is easier. The question is whether the light gray stays light gray at larger sizes. Some sites scale in a way that doesn't improve contrast. And does the layout break? Overlapping text, cut-off content—that would make things worse. I'd want to verify.

**On the footer:** I looked for phone and email. Alternative contact methods matter. If the form is hard to use or I prefer to call, I need those visible. Were they in the footer? In light gray? I didn't find them easily. Footer links and contact details often use the lowest contrast on the page. For someone like me, they might as well not exist.

**On the six service boxes:** Each had a heading and a description. The headings—slightly bolder, slightly darker—were my anchor. I could skim those. "Discovery & Strategy," "UX Research," "Design," "Development," "Prototyping," "Managed Support." The descriptions underneath? Paragraphs of that same light gray. I got the gist. I didn't read every word. I couldn't. The contrast and font weight made it too costly. A design firm should want me to read their services. They should make it easy.

**On focus indicators:** I tab through sites sometimes. Keyboard navigation. If focus indicators are faint or missing, I lose my place. I don't know where I am. The user mentioned that focus indicators may be faint or missing on this site. I didn't test it thoroughly, but that would be another barrier. Visible focus—a clear outline, a strong border—is essential. Without it, keyboard users are lost.

**On what "included" feels like:** When a site gets contrast right, I feel seen. I can read without squinting. I can find links without guessing. I can complete tasks without exhaustion. LaunchPad Lab didn't give me that. I felt dismissed. I felt like an afterthought. For a firm that builds digital products, that's a missed opportunity. They could demonstrate their values right here. Instead, they designed for aesthetics first. I hope they listen.

**On the case studies:** I glanced at the Work section. Project cards, thumbnails, descriptions. The descriptions—more light gray paragraphs. I didn't dive deep. I knew what I'd find. Same barriers. Same strain. I got the gist: they've done real projects, they have portfolio pieces. The visuals helped. But the written copy? I'd need the same strategies: skim headings, grab what I can, skip the rest. I didn't have the energy. I'd come back another day—or I wouldn't. A site that respected my eyes would make case studies readable. Bold headings. Dark text. Underlined links. This one didn't.

**On comparison to other agencies:** I've looked at other digital product firms. Some are worse—tiny fonts, no structure, even lighter gray. LaunchPad Lab isn't the worst. But it's not good. The bar for "acceptable" for me is: can I read the key information without wanting to quit? Can I find the contact path without guessing? Can I do it in under five minutes without a headache? I did it, but barely. A site that gets it right would feel effortless. I'd leave thinking, "That was easy." I didn't. I left thinking, "I need a break."

**Final thoughts:** I completed the task. I know LaunchPad Lab does AI-centric digital product design and development—discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, managed support. I found the contact form via "Connect with an Expert." I could have filled it out. The information was there. But the journey was punishing. Every typographic choice—the light gray, the thin fonts, the links without underlines—made it harder. For a firm that builds digital products, this feels like a gap. Fix the contrast. Add underlines. Respect your readers. It's not that hard.

**On who this affects:** I'm not the only one. Age-related contrast sensitivity changes affect many people over 50. Bright light, screen glare, tired eyes—all make it worse. When a site uses #666 on white, it's not just "aesthetic." It's a barrier. I hope this feedback helps LaunchPad Lab do better. For their clients, and for users like me.
