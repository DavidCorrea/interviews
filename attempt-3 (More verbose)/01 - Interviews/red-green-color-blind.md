## First-Person Narrative

I opened LaunchPad Lab's site because I'm researching digital product agencies for an upcoming AI/ML project. A colleague referred me. I'm Marcus—34, product manager, Chicago. I've had deuteranopia my whole life. Red and green look the same to me. Brown, yellow, gray—depending on saturation. I've learned to navigate the web without color cues. I expect professional sites—especially from a digital product firm—to work for me. LaunchPad Lab didn't.

**The hero was fine.** "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." Big headline. I could read it. The supporting copy—I got the gist. But then I started scanning for links. Work. Services. About. "Connect with an Expert." Where were they? I looked at the nav. The links—were they underlined? No. They were colored. Some shade I couldn't distinguish from the body text. I had to hover to see if anything changed. A slight color shift? Useless to me. I Tabbed through. That's my workaround. Keyboard navigation reveals focus. But visually? I couldn't tell which text was a link and which was static. I had to guess. I clicked "Services" because it was in the nav bar and looked like it belonged there. It worked. But I shouldn't have to guess. Links need underlines. Or icons. Or something that isn't color.

**The six service boxes.** I scrolled down. Discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, managed support. I read the headings. Each box had a "Learn more" or similar link. Same problem. Colored text. No underline. I hovered. Did the color change? I couldn't tell. Maybe it got slightly darker or lighter. For me, that's noise. I Tabbed to find the links. When I focused, was there an outline? A border? I'm not sure I saw one. If the focus indicator was a subtle color change, I missed it. I rely on visible focus. Outline. Underline. Something I can see. Color-only focus is invisible. I eventually found the service links by Tabbing. But a casual scan? I would have missed them. They blended with the body text.

**The statistics section.** 12+ years. 730+ projects. 4.8 rating. Numbers. Clear. No red or green that I could detect. Good. The award badges—I didn't study them closely. Badges often use brand colors. If any badge relied on red vs. green to convey meaning, I wouldn't have known. I assume they're decorative. I moved on.

**The testimonials and case studies.** Long quote blocks. I skimmed. The "View project" links—again, colored. No underlines. I had to Tab to find them. Same pattern everywhere. Links that look like body text. Hover states that might change color. Focus states that might change color. I see none of it. I'm flying blind. I use Tab, Enter, and context. "This is probably a link because it's in a card." Not good enough. A link should announce itself. Underline. Icon. Label. Not "trust me, it's a different color."

**I found the contact path.** "Connect with an Expert" in the nav. It was styled as a button—more prominent. I could tell it was interactive. I clicked. Contact page. Testimonials above the form. Five blocks. I scrolled past. I needed the form.

**The form broke me.** Name. Email. Company. Dropdown. Message. I filled them out. Intentionally wrong. I wanted to test validation. I left the email blank. I typed "abc" in the email field. I submitted. Nothing happened. Or—something happened. I couldn't tell. The fields. Did they get a red border? A green border? I have no idea. Red and green are the same to me. I stared at the form. Was there an error message? Text? "Invalid email"? "This field is required"? I didn't see it. Maybe it was there, in small text. Maybe it was red. If it was red, it blended. I couldn't find it. I tried again. Valid email this time. I submitted. Success? Did the border turn green? Did a success message appear? I couldn't tell. I refreshed. I tried invalid data again. Red border? Invisible. Green border? Invisible. I was guessing. I had to assume the form worked or didn't work based on whether the page changed. No icons. No "Invalid" or "Success" text that I could find. No checkmark. No X. Just—maybe—a colored border. Useless.

**Button states.** The submit button. Default state. Hover state. Did it change color on hover? Probably. I wouldn't know. Focus state—when I Tabbed to it, could I see the focus? I think there was a faint outline. Maybe. It wasn't strong. The service box hover states—lift, scale, shadow. Those I could feel. But if the only feedback was "button turns slightly greener on hover," I got nothing. Color-only state changes are a black hole for me.

**Required fields.** Were they marked? Red asterisk? I wouldn't see it. If the only indicator was a red asterisk, it's invisible. I need "Required" text. Or an asterisk with a legend. Or both. I filled out the form by process of elimination—every field looked the same, so I tried to fill everything. I'm used to that. But it's exhausting. And error feedback? If the only feedback is "this field has a red border," I'll submit invalid forms. I've done it before. I've had to ask colleagues to check. "Did my form go through? Were there errors?" Embarrassing. Unnecessary. A simple "Invalid email" or an X icon would fix it.

**What I found.** LaunchPad Lab does AI-centric digital product design and development. Services: discovery, strategy, UX research, design, prototyping, managed support. Contact: "Connect with an Expert" → form. I got the information. I completed the task. But the journey was hostile. Links I couldn't identify. Form validation I couldn't see. Button states I couldn't perceive. A digital product firm—one that builds experiences for clients—should know that 8% of men and 0.5% of women have red-green color deficiency. We're not rare. We're your users.

**Would I contact them?** I could. The form exists. I could fill it out correctly and hope it worked. But I wouldn't trust it. If I got no confirmation—no "Thank you, we received your message" in plain text—I'd wonder. Did it go through? Were there errors I missed? I'd probably send a follow-up email. Or call. Or choose a competitor whose form tells me what's happening. Non-color cues. Text. Icons. That's the bar.

**Rating: 2 out of 5.** I completed the task. I found what they do and how to contact them. But the links blended. The form validation was invisible. The button states were a guess. I had to use workarounds—Tab to find links, assume the form worked, hope for the best. A 3 would mean it was tolerable. A 2 means I got there, but I don't feel confident. I don't feel like the site was designed for users like me. A design firm's site should demonstrate inclusive design. This one didn't.

## Additional Reflections

**On links:** Underlines. That's all I need. Every link gets an underline. Visited state can be a different underline style. Hover can add a background or bold. But the default state—underline. I shouldn't have to Tab through the page to discover links. I shouldn't have to guess. Designers remove underlines for aesthetics. I get it. But for 8% of men, that's a barrier. Add them. Or add icons. Or add "link" in the label. Something that isn't color.

**On form validation:** Red borders are invisible. Green borders are invisible. I need text. "Invalid email." "This field is required." "Please enter a valid phone number." Or icons. ✓ for valid. ✗ for invalid. Or both. And success—"Thank you, we received your message." In plain text. Not a green checkmark in the corner. Not a green border. Words. I need words.

**On button states:** Hover, focus, active, disabled. If the only difference is color, I'm lost. Use outline. Use border. Use underline. Use opacity for disabled. Use an icon. Use a label. "Submit" vs. "Submitting..."—that's text. I can read that. "Button is now slightly greener"—I can't see that.

**On the service boxes:** The hover effect—lift, scale, shadow—that helped. I could tell something was interactive when the card moved. That's a non-color cue. Good. But the links inside? Still colored. Still no underline. The card movement helped me find the box. It didn't help me find the link.

**On the "Connect with an Expert" button:** It was styled as a button. That helped. Buttons have shape. They have padding. They stand out. So I could find it. But if the primary CTA was a link styled only with color—green text, no underline—I would have missed it. Buttons work. Links need more.

**On trust:** When a form doesn't give me clear feedback, I lose trust. I've submitted forms and gotten no response. I've wondered if they went through. I've had to follow up. "Did you get my message?" It's awkward. It's avoidable. Text. Icons. Explicit confirmation. That's all it takes.

**On what would have helped:** Underlines on all links. "Invalid" and "Valid" text for form fields. ✓ and ✗ icons. "Thank you, we received your message" after submit. Visible focus indicators—2px outline, high contrast. Required fields marked with "Required" or an asterisk with a legend. No reliance on red or green for any meaning. That would have transformed my experience.

**On comparison to other sites:** I've used forms with inline error text. "Please enter a valid email address." Right there. Under the field. I can read it. I fix the field. I submit again. Success. "Your message has been sent." I see it. I'm done. LaunchPad Lab didn't give me that. If they did, I missed it. And if the only cue was a colored border, I'll never see it.

**On the award badges:** I didn't study them. Badges and certifications often use brand colors—red, green, blue. If any badge used red vs. green to indicate status or meaning, I wouldn't have known. I assume they're decorative. But designers sometimes use colored dots or indicators. "Green = certified, red = pending." That would be invisible to me. I'd want text. "Certified" or "Award Winner." Not a colored dot.

**On the statistics:** The numbers were fine. 12+ years, 730+ projects, 4.8 rating. No red or green that I could detect. If the 4.8 rating had a green star or red X to indicate positive/negative, I might have missed it. But as plain numbers, they worked. That's the pattern. When information is in text or numbers, I get it. When it's in color, I don't.

**On the footer:** I didn't spend much time there. Footer links—same problem as the rest of the site. Colored. No underlines. I'd have to Tab to find them. Privacy policy, terms, social links. All invisible as links if color is the only cue. I've learned to assume footer text is often linked. I click and see. But that's a workaround. Not a solution.

**On browser extensions:** I've tried color-shifting extensions. They remap red and green to other colors—blue, yellow. They help sometimes. But they're imperfect. They can break other parts of the site. And I shouldn't need a browser extension to use a professional website. The site should work without it. A digital product firm should build for accessibility by default.

**On the emotional toll:** When a site uses color alone, it feels like I'm not considered. I'm 34. I've had this my whole life. I've developed strategies. I Tab. I guess. I ask others to verify. But it's exhausting. Every link hunt, every form uncertainty—it adds up. I expect better from a firm that builds digital products. Their clients probably have users like me. If their own site fails me, what will they build for others?

**On what "good" would look like:** Every link underlined. Every form error in text. Every success in words. Focus indicators I can see. Required fields labeled. No red. No green. Or red and green with something else—icon, text, pattern. That's the bar. It's not high. It's WCAG Level A. LaunchPad Lab didn't clear it.

**Final thoughts:** I completed the task. I know what LaunchPad Lab does. I found the contact form. But the experience was hostile. Links I couldn't identify. Validation I couldn't see. States I couldn't perceive. Fix the basics. Add non-color cues. It's not that hard. WCAG 1.4.1 says it. Don't use color alone. This site did. And I paid the price.
