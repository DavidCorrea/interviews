---

## First Impressions

I landed on the homepage and my clock started ticking. My inventory system is failing right now. Stock is mismanaged. I'm hemorrhaging money every day this goes unfixed. I found LaunchPad Lab through a quick search and I need to know three things in the next ten seconds: What do they do? Can they help me? How do I reach them?

The hero headline reads: **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."**

That tells me almost nothing. "AI Innovation" — I don't need AI innovation. I need someone to build me an inventory management application. "Digital Solutions" — that's so broad it could be anything from a marketing website to a data warehouse. "Results that Matter" — every company says that. This is exactly the kind of vague, feel-good tagline that makes me want to hit the back button.

But I don't leave yet. I skim the subtext below the hero: "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."

Okay — "product development services" and "we build high-impact digital products" — now I'm getting somewhere. They build things. Digital products. That could be what I need. But it took two full sentences of marketing copy to get there, and the hero headline itself wasted my time with buzzwords.

There's a prominent blue button: **"Connect with an Expert."** That's good. It's right there in the hero. One click to presumably reach someone. I note that and keep scanning.

## Trying to Understand What They Do

I look at the navigation bar. It has: **Services**, **Technologies**, **Industries**, **Our Work**, **About Us**, **Insights**, **Contact**. "Contact" is right there in the main nav — visible, not hidden. That's a relief. "Services" is also there, which is where I'd expect to find out what they actually do.

I hover over "Services" and a mega-menu drops down listing: **AI Automation**, **Web App Development**, **Mobile App Development**, **Salesforce Development**, **Product Strategy & Design**, **Managed Services & Support**. There's also a blurb: "Our cross-functional teams have the skills and experience to support the full digital product lifecycle, using proven methods to deliver more better and faster with AI at the core."

**Web App Development** — that's what I need. I can see it right there in the Services dropdown. That's a critical data point. They build web applications. My inventory management system is a web application problem. There's a match.

But I had to hover over a dropdown menu to find this. The homepage hero didn't tell me this. The hero said "AI Innovation" when it should have said "We build custom web and mobile applications for businesses." One clear sentence would have saved me the hover, the scan, the second-guessing.

## Scrolling the Homepage — As Fast as Possible

I scroll down quickly, skimming. I'm not reading paragraphs. I'm looking for headlines, bullet points, anything that confirms they can help me.

I see a section titled **"Your Strategic AI Partner"** with the subhead **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."** More AI. Everything is AI. I get it — AI is trendy. But I don't care about AI right now. I need an app built. The constant AI messaging is making me wonder: are they an AI company that happens to build apps, or an app development company that uses AI? That distinction matters to me, and the site isn't making it clear.

Below that are six service cards under **"Driving ROI with AI"** and **"Make AI Your Competitive Advantage"**:

1. **AI Automation & Agentic AI** — "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce"
2. **Web Application Development** — "Bespoke, redefining experiences"
3. **Mobile Application Development** — "Meeting users where they are"
4. **Salesforce Development** — "Solving business problems"
5. **Product Strategy & Design** — "Agile, cross-functional expertise"
6. **Managed Services & Support** — "Operating as an extension of your team"

The card for **Web Application Development** says "Bespoke, redefining experiences." What does that even mean? I need someone to build me an inventory tracking system with barcode scanning, warehouse management, and real-time stock levels. "Bespoke, redefining experiences" sounds like a perfume ad. These descriptions are completely useless to someone trying to evaluate whether this company can solve a specific business problem.

I keep scrolling. There's a **"Problems We Solve"** section with tabs: Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement, Scalable Solutions, Expansive Resources, Speed to Market. The **"Operational Efficiency"** tab says "Streamline processes with digital products to enhance productivity." That's closer to what I need — streamlining processes — but it's still vague. No mention of inventory, supply chain, logistics, distribution, or warehouse management. I have to infer that my problem fits their capabilities rather than seeing it stated explicitly.

The stats section says **"12+ Years in Business"**, **"730+ Projects"**, **"240+ Clients"** with 90% working with them longer than one year. Impressive numbers, and the repeat client rate is a good sign. I note this quickly and move on.

There's a section describing their approach: **Discover → Deliver → Release → Ongoing Support**. This tells me they have a process. Good. But I don't have time to study each phase right now. I need to talk to someone.

The case studies carousel shows work for Prosci (Salesforce CRM, 5,400+ users), CDK Global (Sales Discovery Portal, 90% reduction in training time), and Millennium Trust Company (3 new digital products, $1M+ new annual revenue). These are real companies with real results. That's reassuring. The CDK Global case — building a sales discovery portal — suggests they can build complex business applications, not just marketing websites. That's relevant to my needs.

## Finding Contact Information

This is where it matters most for me. I need to reach someone now.

**Option 1: The nav.** I click "Contact" in the main navigation. One click. I land on the contact page. The headline says **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** followed by **"Complete the form below to tell us about your project. We will get in touch with you as soon as possible."**

There's a form. I see fields for First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, and "How Can We Help You?" That's five fields — not terrible, but "We will get in touch with you as soon as possible" is not the same as "We'll respond within 2 hours" or "Call us right now." When is "as soon as possible"? Tomorrow? Next week? I'm losing money every day. I don't want to fill out a form and wait.

I scroll down past the form. There's a testimonials section — five client quotes in a carousel. I don't have time for testimonials right now. I'm looking for a phone number.

I keep scrolling. Finally, below the testimonials, I find a **"Let's Connect"** section with three cards:

- **Email**: contact@launchpadlab.com
- **Call**: (312) 888-9651
- **Connect with Us on LinkedIn**

There it is. A phone number. **(312) 888-9651.** That's what I needed. But I had to scroll past a form AND a testimonials carousel to find it. The phone number should be at the top of the contact page — or better yet, in the header of every page.

**Option 2: The footer.** Looking at the footer on any page, I can find the address (2045 W Grand Ave Ste B PMB 37406, Chicago, Illinois 60612) and the phone number (312) 888-9651. So the phone number is technically on every page — but buried at the very bottom, in the footer, in small text. As an urgent user, I should not have to scroll to the absolute bottom of a page to find a phone number.

**Option 3: The hero CTA.** The "Connect with an Expert" button in the hero links to the contact page. One click, then I still have to scroll past the form and testimonials to find the phone number. That's one click plus significant scrolling.

## My Frustrations

1. **The hero failed me.** "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." doesn't tell me what this company does. A clear statement like "We build custom web and mobile applications for businesses" would have immediately told me I'm in the right place. Instead, I had to hover over the Services menu and scan card descriptions to piece it together.

2. **No phone number in the header.** I am a person who picks up the phone. I want to call right now. The phone number is only in the footer and buried below testimonials on the contact page. It should be in the site header, visible on every page, no scrolling required.

3. **The contact page prioritizes the form over direct contact.** I don't want to fill out a form and wait. I want to call or email someone directly. The form is the first thing on the contact page. The email and phone number are below a testimonials carousel. For an urgent user, this is backwards — direct contact methods should be above the form, not below it.

4. **AI saturation is confusing and off-putting.** Nearly every section headline mentions AI. The title is "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." I came here because I need an app built, not because I need AI. The AI messaging makes me wonder if they even do straightforward application development anymore, or if everything has to be an "AI solution." This is a barrier for a user who has a specific, non-AI problem.

5. **Vague service descriptions waste my time.** "Bespoke, redefining experiences" and "Meeting users where they are" tell me nothing about what they actually build or how. Every second I spend deciphering marketing copy is a second wasted.

6. **No mention of urgency, speed, or rapid development.** My problem is time-sensitive. I'm losing money every day. Nowhere on the homepage does it say "We can get started this week" or "Rapid prototyping in 2 weeks" or anything that signals they understand urgency. The services page mentions "2 Sprints to Build a Prototype" and "6 Weeks or Less to Launch" and "5x Faster Time to Market" under their "Discovery Space Navigator" tool — but that's on a completely different page that I would need to navigate to separately. This speed messaging should be front and center on the homepage.

## What Worked

Despite my frustrations, some things did work:

1. **"Contact" is in the main navigation.** One click to the contact page. No hunting.
2. **"Connect with an Expert" CTA in the hero.** Prominent, clear, and leads directly to the contact page.
3. **The Services mega-menu clearly lists "Web App Development" and "Mobile App Development."** I could confirm they build apps within a couple seconds of hovering over the menu.
4. **Real case studies with real metrics.** CDK Global, Prosci, Millennium Trust — these are recognizable companies with specific results. That builds confidence fast.
5. **Phone number and email exist.** They're not hidden — they're just not prominent enough. But they're there: (312) 888-9651 and contact@launchpadlab.com.
6. **The company has been around since 2012 with 240+ clients.** That tells me they're established, not a fly-by-night startup.

## Goal Achievement

**Goal 1: Find what they do.** Partially achieved. The hero didn't tell me. The Services dropdown did. It took about 10-15 seconds of scanning rather than the 3-5 seconds it should have taken. Grade: C+.

**Goal 2: Can they help with my problem?** Likely yes. "Web Application Development" is listed as a core service. Case studies show they've built complex business applications (sales portals, CRM integrations, enterprise tools). But I had to piece this together — the site never explicitly says "We build custom business applications like inventory management, CRM systems, or operational dashboards." Grade: B-.

**Goal 3: Find how to contact them.** Achieved, but with unnecessary friction. I found the phone number (312) 888-9651 and email contact@launchpadlab.com, but the phone number required either scrolling to the footer or navigating to the contact page and scrolling past a form and testimonials. For an urgent user, this should be zero-scroll. Grade: C.

## Final Decision

**I would not leave the site.** But I'm frustrated, and that frustration matters. A less patient person than me — or someone with three other tabs open to competing agencies — might have left after the vague hero and the AI-saturated messaging.

I would pick up the phone and call **(312) 888-9651** right now. I would not fill out the form. I would not wait for "as soon as possible." I'd call, explain that my inventory system is failing, and ask if they can start a discovery conversation this week. If the call goes to voicemail or a generic receptionist, that would be the final straw — I'd move on to the next agency on my list.

The site gave me enough to justify a phone call. But it made me work harder than I should have to get there. Every second of confusion, every vague tagline, every scroll past marketing fluff was a second where I considered leaving. For a company that sells "Speed to Market," their own website doesn't move fast enough for an urgent buyer.
