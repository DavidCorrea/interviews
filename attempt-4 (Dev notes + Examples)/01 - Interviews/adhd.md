## The Experience

Okay, so my boss asked me to look into digital product agencies for a project we're kicking off. I've got LaunchPad Lab on my list along with three other firms, and I'm trying to get through all of them this afternoon. I've got Slack pinging, a meeting in 40 minutes, and I just want to get in, figure out what these people do, see if they're a fit, grab contact info, and move on. That's it.

### Landing on the Homepage

I hit launchpadlab.com and the first thing I see is a big headline: **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."** Fine. That's punchy enough. I can work with that—it tells me they're in the AI and digital product space, which is relevant. There's a subheading underneath that fills it in a bit more: they help organizations "harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services." Good. I already have a rough idea of what they do, and I haven't had to scroll yet. That's a win.

But then my eyes start darting around. There's a **scrolling logo ticker** right below—Kawasaki, Harvard, Whirlpool, Northwestern—and it's *moving*. Continuously. It never stops. My brain latches onto it immediately. I watch the logos slide by for a few seconds before I catch myself. That kind of constant motion is like a magnet for my attention. I know it's supposed to build credibility, but for me it's just noise that pulls me away from actually reading the content. I can't turn it off. There's no pause button. It just keeps going.

I try to scroll past it, but as I do, things start **fading in from below**. The sections use these scroll-triggered animations—content slides up as I reach it. Each time something new fades in, my eyes jump to it. It's like the page is saying "look here! no, here! no, over HERE!" I count at least six or seven of these animated entrance effects as I scroll down. Individually they're subtle, but cumulatively they keep pulling my focus. I'd love a way to turn these off—like a reduced motion toggle—but I don't see one anywhere on the page.

### Trying to Understand What They Do

I scroll down to a section called **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."** There's a paragraph of text here, and it's... dense. It's not a wall of text exactly, but it's a chunky paragraph that my eyes glaze over. Something about "deep expertise in product design and development" and "cutting-edge AI consulting" and "cross-functional teams." It's the kind of corporate language that all blends together for me. I skim it but don't really absorb it.

What actually helps me is the **service cards** below that. There are six of them:

1. AI Automation & Agentic AI  
2. Web Application Development  
3. Mobile Application Development  
4. Salesforce Development  
5. Product Strategy & Design  
6. Managed Services & Support  

Each one has a short tagline—"Enabling an autonomous digital workforce," "Bespoke, redefining experiences," etc.—and a "Learn More" link. *This* is the kind of structure my brain can handle. Short labels, clear categories, quick scan. I can see at a glance that they do web apps, mobile apps, Salesforce stuff, AI automation, and design. That's exactly what I needed. If the whole page were structured like this, I'd be in great shape.

But then I keep scrolling—because the page keeps going—and I hit **"Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast"** with six more boxes: Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement, Scalable Solutions, Expansive Resources, Speed to Market. These are vague enough that they don't add much to my understanding. They feel like filler. My attention is already starting to fragment.

Then there are **big animated statistics**: "12+ Years in Business," "730+ Projects," "240+ Clients." These are fine—they're scannable and give me quick credibility signals. But they're followed by yet another section: **"Accelerate Digital Product Speed to Market"** with a multi-step process breakdown (Discover, Deliver, Release). Then *another* section about AI. Then case studies. Then blog posts. Then a contact form.

This homepage is **really, really long.** I count what feels like ten or eleven distinct sections before I reach the footer. By the time I'm halfway down, I've already forgotten what I read at the top. My working memory is tapped. I don't know what the "main point" of the page is anymore because every section introduces a new angle—services, then problems they solve, then their process, then AI again, then case studies, then blog content. There's no clear "you've found what you need, here's your next step" moment. It just keeps going.

### The Navigation Menu

I go back up to the navigation to try to orient myself. The nav has: **Services, Technologies, Industries, Our Work, About Us, Insights, Contact.** That's seven items, which is a lot, but manageable.

The problem is when I hover over **Services**—a **mega-menu dropdown** opens up. It shows all six service categories in a two-column layout, plus a description paragraph, plus a "View Services" button. It's a lot of information hitting me at once in a dropdown. Same thing with **Industries**—nine industry categories in three columns, plus a paragraph, plus a button. These mega-menus are visually dense. For someone who processes one thing at a time, having nine options suddenly appear in a grid is overwhelming. I have to consciously slow down and scan each column individually, and by the time I get to the third column, I've forgotten what was in the first.

I also notice the **Contact** link right there in the nav, which is good. That's clearly labeled and easy to find. Credit where it's due.

### Finding Contact Information

I click **Contact** in the nav and land on the contact page. The headline says **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** and below it says "Complete the form below to tell us about your project." Great, a form. Simple enough.

Except... where's the form? I see a blank area where I assume the form should be, and then a message: **"Notice: JavaScript is required for this content."** 

I use Reader View sometimes to strip out distractions when I'm scanning websites, and I have a few browser extensions that block certain scripts to reduce visual noise. If any of those are interfering with JavaScript, the entire contact form just *doesn't exist*. There's no fallback. No "email us at X" right where the form should be. Just a blank space and a notice that I might not even read because my eyes skip over small gray text.

Now, I *do* eventually find contact details if I scroll further down. There's a **"Let's Connect"** section that lists:

- **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
- **Call:** (312) 888-9651  
- **LinkedIn**  

This is actually great. Direct, clear, no-nonsense. But it's *below* the broken form area and below a long testimonials carousel. If I'd given up at the empty form, I would have missed it entirely.

The **footer** also has the phone number and address (2045 W Grand Ave Ste B, Chicago, IL 60612), plus links to Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. So the information *is* there, but it requires scrolling past an empty form and a testimonials section to reach it.

### The Bloom Popup

At some point while I'm browsing—I think it's after I've been on the site for maybe 30 seconds or a minute—a **popup** appears. It's the Bloom email opt-in thing. I don't remember exactly what it said because by that point I was already in the middle of reading something, and the popup yanked my attention away completely. I instinctively closed it, but it took me a second to find the close button, and by the time I did, I'd lost my place on the page. I had to scroll back and figure out where I was. That kind of interruption is genuinely derailing for me. It's not just annoying—it breaks my entire train of thought, and with ADHD, getting back on track after an interruption like that can take real effort.

### The Carousels and Sliders

The homepage and other pages use **carousels** quite a bit—for case studies, for testimonials on the contact page, and for other content. Carousels are tricky for me. Content that requires me to notice there are more slides, then figure out how to advance them, then remember what was on the previous slide... it's a lot of cognitive overhead. On the contact page, there's a testimonials carousel with five quotes. I read the first one, didn't immediately realize there were more, then noticed the navigation dots at the bottom. By then I'd already moved on mentally. I probably missed four out of five testimonials.

### The Wistia Video

There's a **video embed** on the homepage (a Wistia player). It doesn't autoplay, which I appreciate—autoplay would have been a disaster for my focus. But the video just sits there as an iframe without a clear label or context about what I'd be watching. I'm not going to click play on an unlabeled video when I'm trying to quickly evaluate a company. I need to know upfront: "Watch our 2-minute approach overview" or something. Otherwise it's just a mystery box and I'll skip it.

### What Worked Well

I don't want to be entirely negative. Some things genuinely worked:

- **The main headline and subheading** on the homepage told me what they do within seconds. That's critical for someone like me.
- **The service cards** with short titles and taglines are exactly how I want to consume information—scannable, categorized, clear.
- **"Contact" in the main navigation** is clearly labeled and easy to spot. I didn't have to hunt for it.
- **Direct contact info** (email, phone, LinkedIn) is available on the contact page, even if it's below the fold.
- **The footer** is well-organized with clear sections for navigation, contact info, and social links.
- **Statistics** (12+ years, 730+ projects, 240+ clients) are easy to scan and give quick credibility.
- **No autoplay video or audio.** Thank you.

### What Didn't Work

- **The scrolling logo ticker** is a persistent visual distraction with no way to pause it.
- **Scroll-triggered animations** (AOS fade-ups) create constant motion as I navigate, fragmenting my attention.
- **The homepage is far too long** with too many competing sections. There's no clear stopping point or prioritized path.
- **Mega-menu dropdowns** present too many options at once without clear hierarchy.
- **The contact form requires JavaScript** and provides no fallback, so users with script-blocking tools see nothing.
- **The Bloom popup** interrupts reading flow unpredictably, causing me to lose my place.
- **Carousels hide content** behind interaction patterns that are easy to miss.
- **Dense paragraphs** in several sections use corporate language that's hard to skim.
- **Repeated "Learn More" links** across service cards all look identical, making it hard to distinguish which I've already looked at.
- **No reduced motion toggle** on the site itself, despite the page having numerous animations.
- **No dark mode option**, though this is a preference rather than a blocker.

### Did I Achieve My Goals?

**Goal 1: Find what LaunchPad Lab does.** Yes—but mostly thanks to the service cards and the homepage headline. If those hadn't been well-structured, the dense paragraphs and endless scrolling would have made this much harder. I'd say I got a solid understanding: they're a Chicago-based digital product firm that does AI consulting, web/mobile app development, Salesforce work, and product design. They've been around since 2012 and have worked with big names.

**Goal 2: Find how to contact them.** Yes, but with friction. The "Contact" link in the nav was easy to find, which is great. But the contact page itself was frustrating—the form didn't load (JavaScript dependency), and I had to scroll past a blank form area and a testimonials carousel to find the actual email and phone number. If I'd been in a bigger rush or more overwhelmed, I might have bounced before finding it.

### Would I Have Left the Site?

Honestly? I came close. The combination of the scrolling logo ticker, the scroll animations, the mega-menu overload, and the Bloom popup all within the first 60 seconds was a lot. If I hadn't been specifically assigned to evaluate this company, I probably would have opened the next agency tab and come back to this one "later"—which, if I'm being honest with myself, means never. The homepage tries to do too much. It wants to tell me everything all at once, and for someone with ADHD, that's the fastest way to make me retain nothing.

The saving grace was that the headline and service cards are genuinely well-done. They gave me what I needed before the page overwhelmed me. But the site would benefit enormously from cleaner focus, shorter pages, and fewer things competing for my attention at the same time.
