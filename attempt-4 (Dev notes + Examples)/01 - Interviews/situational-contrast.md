## Initial Impressions

I'm sitting outside at a cafe — it's a bright afternoon, sun is hitting my screen at an angle. I've got my laptop brightness maxed out, and I'm shading the screen with one hand while trying to browse with the other. This is just how I work most days.

The page loads and the first thing I see is the hero section at the top. It's got a blue background with some kind of background image, and there's a large white heading: **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."** That heading is actually one of the better parts of the site for me — the white text is bold and large against the darker blue, so even with the sun washing things out, I can make out the headline. I can tell this company has something to do with AI and digital products. Good start.

Below the headline there's a paragraph of body text explaining what they do. This is where my first struggle hits. The text appears to be a lighter gray tone — not black, not white, but that middle-gray that designers love. Indoors it probably looks fine, but out here with the sun glaring off my screen, it's noticeably harder to read. I have to squint and lean forward. I can make out fragments — "harness the power of AI," "consulting and product development," "modernize operations" — enough to get the gist, but it's uncomfortable. The text doesn't feel solid against the background; it's like it's fading into the brightness around it.

There's a white button that says **"Connect with an Expert"** — it stands out reasonably well against the blue hero background. I can see it and I can tell it's a button. That's a relief.

## Navigation

The navigation bar sits at the top of the page, overlaid on the hero section. The links — Services, Technologies, Industries, Our Work, About Us, Insights, Contact — appear to be light-colored text on the blue/dark hero background. On my screen in this light, the navigation links are readable but not crisp. The text is relatively small and not bold, so combined with the glare, I find myself second-guessing whether I'm reading "Industries" or "Insights" without really focusing. They're there, but they don't pop.

The **"Contact"** link in the navigation is what I need to find eventually. I can see it at the far right of the nav bar. It doesn't have any special styling to differentiate it from the other links — no button treatment, no color contrast boost. It's the same style as the rest. I'd prefer it to stand out more as a key call-to-action, especially since I'm struggling to see fine details out here.

## Scrolling Through the Homepage

### "Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses"

Right below the hero there's a section with client logos and a blue text label above them that reads "Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses." That blue label text — it's the brand blue color on a white background. In direct sunlight, this blue-on-white is significantly harder to read than black-on-white would be. The contrast ratio is probably technically passing, but the blue gets washed out by the glare, and the text is relatively small. I can barely read it. The client logos below (Kawasaki Engines, Harvard University, Whirlpool, etc.) are mostly fine since logos tend to be bold graphical marks, but some of the more subtle or lighter-colored logos blend into the white background.

### "Your Strategic AI Partner" Section

This section has a video embed on the left and text on the right. The subheading reads **"Your Strategic AI Partner"** in that same brand blue color on white. Again — I'm struggling with this blue-on-white text. In the sun it just doesn't have enough punch. The main heading below it, **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise"**, is in black (or near-black) and much easier to read. The body paragraph underneath returns to that mid-gray color (#555 or so), and while it's technically higher contrast than the blue text, it's still tiring to read outdoors. I find myself skimming rather than reading because my eyes are straining.

This section tells me what I need to know: LaunchPad Lab does product design, development, and AI consulting for businesses. I've absorbed that mostly from the headings, not the body text.

### Service Cards Section

There's a grid of six service cards: **AI Automation & Agentic AI**, **Web Application Development**, **Mobile Application Development**, **Salesforce Development**, **Product Strategy & Design**, and **Managed Services & Support**. Each card has an icon, a title, a brief description, and a "Learn More" link.

The section header uses the same blue-on-white eyebrow text ("Driving ROI with AI") that I've been struggling with throughout. The main heading **"Make AI Your Competitive Advantage"** is in dark text — readable.

The card titles (h3 headings) appear to be in black or very dark text, which works. But the descriptions under each card title are in that mid-gray body text color, and they're short phrases like "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce" and "Bespoke, redefining experiences." These are hard to read in the sunlight. The **"Learn More"** text at the bottom of each card — I can see it's there but the text is small and appears to be either black or dark-colored. What concerns me more is that the cards seem to have a hover interaction where they change appearance. Since I'm fighting the sun already, I'm not going to notice subtle hover state changes. If important information is only revealed on hover, I'll miss it entirely.

### "Problems We Solve" Tabs Section

This is a tabbed interface with six tabs: Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement, Scalable Solutions, Expansive Resources, and Speed to Market. The active tab appears to be visually differentiated from the inactive ones.

Here's my issue: **I cannot clearly distinguish which tab is active and which ones are inactive.** The differentiation between active and inactive tab states appears to rely on subtle visual changes — maybe a slight color shift or underline. In bright sunlight, these subtle cues are completely washed out for me. I have to guess which tab I'm looking at. The tab labels themselves (bold text) are readable, but the interactive state communication is lost.

The section header again uses blue eyebrow text ("Problems We Solve") that's hard to read, with a more readable black heading below it.

### Stats Section

**"12+ Years in Business," "730+ Projects," "240+ Clients"** — these stats use large, bold, black text on a white background. This is actually one of the best sections on the page for me. The numbers are huge and high-contrast. The descriptions below each number are in the mid-gray body text, which is harder to read, but the key information (the numbers themselves) comes through clearly. If the whole site had this level of contrast, I'd be fine.

### "Our Signature Approach" — Dark Blue Section

This section has a **dark navy blue background** (#021641 or similar) with light text on top. Sections like "Discover," "Deliver," "Release" with descriptions underneath. After struggling with the light backgrounds throughout the page, this section is actually a relief. The dark background with white text provides strong contrast that holds up even in bright sunlight. I can read the process steps clearly. The headings and body text both stand out against the dark background.

This tells me something important: **the dark-background sections of this site work better for me than the light-background sections.** If the site used a dark theme or higher-contrast text throughout, my experience would be dramatically better.

### Inline Callout — "Put AI to Work"

There's a callout section with the heading **"Transform how your business operates with custom AI solutions"** and a blue button labeled "Learn More." The text appears to be dark on a light background, which is readable for the heading. The body text is again that mid-gray — struggling. The blue button (#1e60bd background, white text) is visible but not as sharp as I'd like.

### Case Study Carousel

Three case studies appear in a carousel: **Prosci**, **CDK Global**, and **Millennium Trust Company**. Each has a colored background (dark purple, blue, green respectively) with white text and statistics. These colored-background cards with white text work reasonably well for me — the backgrounds are dark enough that the white text maintains decent contrast even in sunlight. The statistics (like "5,400+ Current Users," "90% Reduction in Training Time") are in large white text and legible.

However, the **carousel dots/navigation** are a problem. I can't clearly see the carousel indicators to know how many slides there are or which one I'm on. Small dots or subtle navigation controls are invisible to me right now.

### Related Content / Blog Cards

Three blog post cards with images and text. The images are washed out in the sunlight — I can barely make out what they depict. The text overlay has a "Blog Post" label (probably in that blue eyebrow color — hard to read) and titles in dark text. The preview text in mid-gray is, as always, a strain.

### "Let's Build Something Great" CTA Section

This is the contact form section at the bottom of the homepage. The heading **"Let's Build Something Great"** is large and dark — I can read it. The subtext "Get in touch with one of our experts today!" is readable too.

But the **contact form itself** is where I hit a wall. The form appears to be loaded dynamically (Ninja Forms), and from my experience with similar forms, the input fields typically have light gray borders and placeholder text. In bright sunlight, **form fields with thin light-gray borders are essentially invisible** to me. I cannot tell where one field ends and another begins. Placeholder text inside fields (like "Your Name," "Email Address") in light gray on white? Completely gone. I would need to tap or click randomly to find the fields and hope for a focus indicator.

**This is a critical barrier.** I came to this site to find how to contact LaunchPad Lab, and the primary contact mechanism (the form) is likely unusable for me in these conditions.

## Attempting to Find Contact Information

Since the form is problematic, I look for alternative contact methods. I scroll to the footer, which has a **dark navy blue background (#021C41) with white text.** This is immediately more readable. I can find:

- **Address**: 2045 W Grand Ave Ste B, PMB 37406, Chicago, Illinois 60612
- **Phone**: (312) 888-9651
- **Social links**: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn

The footer is actually one of the most accessible parts of the entire site for me. The high contrast between white text and the dark navy background holds up well in sunlight. I can clearly see and read the contact information.

I also navigate to the **Contact page** (launchpadlab.com/contact/). It has a "Let's Connect" section with three cards: **Email** (contact@launchpadlab.com), **Call** ((312) 888-9651), and **Connect with Us on LinkedIn**. These cards appear on a light background with the information in what I expect is dark text — readable for the main text, though the eyebrow labels and card design elements may be subtle.

## Goal Achievement

**Goal 1 — Find what LaunchPad Lab does**: **Partially achieved, with difficulty.** I was able to gather from the large, high-contrast headings that LaunchPad Lab is a digital product development consultancy focused on AI, serving enterprise clients across industries. However, the detailed descriptions of their services, approach, and differentiators — all rendered in mid-gray body text with blue eyebrow labels — were difficult to read. I got the gist from headings and large text, but missed nuance.

**Goal 2 — Find how to contact them**: **Achieved, but not through the primary path.** The contact form on the homepage was likely unusable due to invisible field borders and placeholder text. I found contact information through the footer (phone number, address) and the Contact page cards (email, phone, LinkedIn). The footer's dark background with white text was the most reliable source of contact info.

## Would I Leave the Site?

Honestly? I came close to leaving during the mid-page sections where every paragraph was mid-gray text on white, and every section label was that washed-out blue. If I didn't have a specific need to research this company, I would have bounced. The dark-background sections (the process grid, the footer) kept me going because they proved the site *could* be readable — it just wasn't consistent.

If I were in a hurry — which I often am, checking sites between meetings at an outdoor cafe — I would absolutely leave and come back later when I was indoors. A competing firm with a higher-contrast design or dark mode option would win my attention on a day like today.

## What Worked

- **Large bold headings** (h1, h2) in black or white on contrasting backgrounds
- **Dark navy sections** (process grid, footer) with white text — excellent contrast that survived sunlight
- **Stats section** with large black numbers on white
- **Hero section headline** — white on blue was passable
- **White CTA button** on blue hero — visible and identifiable
- **Case study cards** with dark colored backgrounds and white text
- **Footer contact information** — dark background made this the most reliable content on the page

## What Failed

- **All mid-gray (#555) body text on white backgrounds** — readable indoors but washed out in sunlight
- **Blue (#1e60bd) eyebrow/label text on white** — insufficient contrast for outdoor use
- **Tab active/inactive states** — completely indistinguishable in sunlight
- **Contact form fields** — expected to have invisible borders and placeholder text
- **Carousel/slider navigation indicators** — invisible
- **Card hover states** — subtle interactions lost in bright conditions
- **Thin borders and separators** — invisible, removing visual structure
- **Client logos with subtle coloring** — some washed out against white backgrounds
- **Small navigation text** on transparent header — strained reading
- **Award badge images** in the small-logos section — details lost

## Summary

LaunchPad Lab's website is designed for indoor, ideal-lighting viewing. It uses a sophisticated, clean color palette that probably looks polished on a monitor in an office. But for someone like me, working outdoors in bright sunlight, the site's reliance on mid-gray body text, blue accent labels, subtle borders, and delicate interactive states creates a consistently degraded experience. The saving grace is the dark-background sections and the large bold headings, which prove that high contrast *is* possible within the site's design system — it's just not applied universally. A dark mode toggle, or simply bumping up text contrast across the board, would make this site usable for me in any lighting condition.
