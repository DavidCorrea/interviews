## Initial Impressions

I typed in the address and the page loaded. The first thing I saw was a large blue banner across the top of the screen with a photograph behind it — it looks like a workspace or office of some kind. The headline reads:

> "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."

Honestly? I have no idea what that means. "AI Innovation" — I've heard of AI on the news, but "digital solutions"? "Results that matter"? That tells me absolutely nothing about what this company actually does. It sounds like something from a commercial that's trying to be impressive without saying anything concrete.

Below the headline there's a smaller paragraph that says something about "harnessing the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services" and "modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth." I had to read that twice. It's very dense. I think they're saying they help businesses use technology? But "tailored consulting" and "product development services" — those are very corporate phrases. I'm not sure if they make websites, or sell computers, or what exactly.

There's a blue button that says **"Connect with an Expert."** I paused here for a good while. Is that how I contact them? It doesn't say "Contact Us" or "Call Us" or "Email Us." It says "Connect with an Expert." That sounds like they want me to talk to a salesperson, not just get their phone number. I don't want to "connect with an expert" — I want to find a phone number or an email address. I'm not clicking that. Not yet, anyway.

## Finding the Navigation

I looked up at the top of the page for a menu. On my laptop screen, I can see a row of links across the top: **Services**, **Technologies**, **Industries**, **Our Work**, **About Us**, **Insights**, and **Contact**.

Good — I can see "Contact" right there in the menu. That's familiar. I can also see "About Us" and "Services," which are labels I recognize. But "Insights"? I don't know what that is. Is that a blog? News? Articles? Why don't they just say "Blog" or "News"? "Insights" sounds like something a management consultant would say.

I noticed that when I hovered my mouse over "Services," a very large panel dropped down from the top of the page. It had icons next to items like "AI Automation," "Web App Development," "Mobile App Development," "Salesforce Development," "Product Strategy & Design," and "Managed Services & Support." There was also a block of text on the right side with a blue button that said "View Services."

This dropdown panel was overwhelming. There were too many items, each with a little black icon next to it, and the text was fairly small. I accidentally moved my mouse away and the whole panel disappeared. When I moved back, it came back again. This popping in and out was jarring. I don't like menus that appear and disappear like that. I prefer a simple list of links on a page, not something that pops up when I hover.

The same thing happened when I hovered over "Industries" — another enormous dropdown with nine different industry names (Financial Services, Healthcare, Professional Services, Insurance, Technology, Legal, Private Equity, Education, Social Impact) plus more text and another button. That's nine industries listed in a popup. It's too much information appearing all at once in a space that will vanish if I move my mouse wrong.

I worry that on a smaller screen or if I were using a tablet, this navigation might turn into one of those three-line "hamburger" menus. I've seen those on other sites and they always confuse me. I look at the screen and I don't see a menu — I see three little lines that apparently I'm supposed to know mean "click here for the menu." My grandchildren tell me it's obvious, but it isn't obvious to me.

## Trying to Understand What They Do

I scrolled down slowly, reading from top to bottom as I always do. Below the big blue banner, there's a section that says **"Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses"** with company logos scrolling sideways across the screen. The logos are moving on their own — sliding from right to left continuously. I find this very distracting. I tried to read the company names but they keep moving. I can see logos that look like they might be from known companies but I can't hold my focus on any one of them because the animation never stops. I don't like things that move on their own on a webpage. It makes me feel like the page is not done loading, or like I'm supposed to be watching instead of reading.

Further down, there's a heading: **"Your Strategic AI Partner"** and another one: **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."** More of the same language. "Strategic AI Partner." "Modern Enterprise." This is not plain English. I'm trying to figure out in simple terms what these people do, and every heading is just more marketing buzzwords.

I kept reading. There's a paragraph that mentions "deep expertise in product design and development" and "cutting-edge AI consulting to solve critical business challenges." So it seems like they design and build technology for businesses. They also mention helping "hundreds of businesses across all industries solve complex problems." All right — I think I'm starting to get a picture: they're a company that builds websites and apps and helps businesses with technology. But it took me a long time to arrive at that, and I still feel uncertain because they keep talking about "AI" as if I should already know what they mean by that in this context.

Then there's a section called **"Driving ROI with AI"** with a subheading **"Make AI Your Competitive Advantage."** ROI? I know that stands for "Return on Investment" from my working days, but throwing acronyms around without explaining them is not helpful. Below that are six boxes or cards:

1. AI Automation & Agentic AI — "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce"
2. Web Application Development — "Bespoke, redefining experiences"
3. Mobile Application Development — "Meeting users where they are"
4. Salesforce Development — "Solving business problems"
5. Product Strategy & Design — "Agile, cross-functional expertise"
6. Managed Services & Support — "Operating as an extension of your team"

Each one has a "Learn More" link. Every single card is labeled with jargon. "Agentic AI"? I have no idea what that is. "Bespoke, redefining experiences"? That's not even a complete sentence. "Agile, cross-functional expertise"? These sound like phrases from a corporate brochure, not plain English that a regular person could understand.

I also noticed that as I scrolled down the page, elements were fading in from the bottom. The cards, the text blocks — they appeared with a swooping animation as I scrolled. I found this disorienting. When I first scrolled to a new section, the content wasn't there yet, and then it slid up into view. It made me feel like I was missing something or that the page was still loading. I prefer content to just be there, sitting still on the page, so I can read it at my own pace.

## Scrolling Further — It Just Keeps Going

The page kept going and going. After the service cards, there was a section called **"Problems We Solve"** with six more items (Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement, Scalable Solutions, Expansive Resources, Speed to Market). Then there were statistics — "12+ Years in Business," "730+ Projects," "240+ Clients." Then something called **"Our Signature Approach"** with a multi-step process (Discover, Deliver, Release) — it looked like a timeline or process diagram.

Then more content: **"Put AI to Work"** with another "Learn More" button. Then **"Our Latest Case Studies"** — with what appeared to be a slider showing different projects they've worked on. I could see one case study at a time and there seemed to be arrows or dots to move between them. I didn't try to use the slider. Sliders that change content confuse me — I never know if there's important information hiding behind one that I'll miss, or how many slides there are. I prefer to just see everything on the page.

Then another logo carousel at the bottom, more scrolling logos. Then a section inviting me to "Connect with an Expert" again. Then finally the footer.

This page is extremely long. I've been scrolling for what feels like several minutes and I still haven't reached the bottom. For a 74-year-old woman who reads methodically, this is exhausting. I lost my place at least twice because the page is so long and the sections blend into each other. I couldn't always tell where one section ended and the next began.

## Finding Contact Information

Now to my main goal: finding out how to contact these people. I saw "Contact" in the top navigation, so I clicked on it. The Contact page loaded with a heading: **"Ready to Build Something Great?"**

That's not what I was expecting. I expected a page that says "Contact Us" with a phone number and email address right at the top. Instead, the heading is another marketing phrase. Below it says: **"Complete the form below to tell us about your project."** I don't have a "project." I just want to talk to someone or send them an email to ask a question.

There is a form, but it requires me to fill in: First Name, Last Name, **Company Email** (why "Company Email"? What if I don't have a company email? I'm retired — I just have my regular email), Company (I don't have a company!), and **"How Can We Help You?"** — a large text box. There's also something about reCAPTCHA and a Submit button.

This form is clearly designed for business people who have a project in mind, not for a general visitor who wants to ask a simple question or just find a phone number. I don't want to fill out a form. I want to call them or send a simple email.

I almost gave up here, but I scrolled down further. Below the form were several testimonial quotes from their clients. Then, finally — at the very bottom of the Contact page, well below the form and the testimonials — I found a section called **"Let's Connect"** with:

- **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com
- **Call:** (312) 888-9651
- **Connect with Us on LinkedIn**

There it is! A phone number and an email address. But I had to scroll past the entire form and all the testimonials to find them. Why isn't the phone number at the top of the Contact page? Why did they bury it below everything else? A person like me who just wants to pick up the phone and call should be able to find that number immediately, not after scrolling through a form I can't fill out and five client quotes I didn't ask for.

I also noticed the phone number is in the footer of every page — "(312) 888-9651" with the address "2045 W Grand Ave Ste B, PMB 37406, Chicago, Illinois 60612." But I had to scroll to the very bottom of very long pages to see it. On the homepage, which goes on and on, the footer felt like it was miles away.

## What Worked

- The word **"Contact"** is visible in the top navigation bar, which is a familiar and expected label. I recognized it immediately.
- The **"About Us"** link is also plainly labeled and in the top navigation.
- The phone number and email address do exist — (312) 888-9651 and contact@launchpadlab.com.
- The footer has clear links to Services, About Us, and Contact.
- The company's physical address is listed in the footer, which gives me some trust that they're a real business.

## What Frustrated Me

- **The hero text is meaningless marketing jargon.** "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter" tells me nothing. I shouldn't have to read three paragraphs of corporate language before I can understand in plain terms what a company does.
- **"Connect with an Expert" is not "Contact."** Every time I saw that button, I hesitated. It doesn't sound like a contact page — it sounds like I'm signing up for a sales call.
- **"Insights" instead of "Blog."** I still don't know why they call it that.
- **The mega dropdown menus are overwhelming.** Too many items, icons, and descriptions appearing in a popup that vanishes when I move my mouse.
- **The auto-scrolling logo carousel is distracting.** It never stops moving. I couldn't read it and I couldn't ignore it.
- **Animations on scroll make the page feel unreliable.** Content should be there when I arrive, not sliding up from below.
- **The homepage is far too long.** By the time I reached the bottom, I'd forgotten what was at the top.
- **The contact form assumes I'm a business person with a project.** It asks for "Company Email" and "Company" — fields I can't fill out as a retired individual.
- **Phone and email are buried on the Contact page.** They're below the form and the testimonials. This should be the very first thing on the page.
- **Pervasive jargon:** "Agentic AI," "bespoke," "cross-functional," "agile sprints," "CSAT," "UX/UI," "ROI," "digital product lifecycle," "discovery call." None of this is plain language.
- **Sliders and carousels** for case studies and logos are disorienting. I don't know how many slides there are or what I'm missing.
- **Too many calls-to-action** on every page — "Learn More," "View Services," "View Industries," "Connect with an Expert," "Book a Discovery Call," "View Case Study." I'm overwhelmed by choices.

## Did I Achieve My Goals?

**Goal 1 — Find what they do:** Partially. After reading the entire homepage very carefully, I concluded they are a company that builds websites, apps, and technology solutions for businesses, with a focus on AI. But I shouldn't have had to work this hard. A simple sentence like "We build websites and apps for businesses" would have saved me a lot of confusion.

**Goal 2 — Find how to contact them:** Yes, eventually. I found the phone number (312) 888-9651 and email contact@launchpadlab.com on the Contact page, but only after scrolling past a form and testimonials. The phone number is also in the footer, but the footer is at the bottom of very long pages.

## Would I Stay on This Site?

If I were genuinely trying to hire someone to help with technology for, say, a community organization I volunteer with, I think I would have left this site partway through. The language is too corporate, the layout too complex, and the experience too overwhelming. I would have looked for a simpler company with a website that tells me in plain English what they do and puts a phone number where I can find it without scrolling for five minutes.

The site isn't designed for people like me. It's designed for busy executives who already speak this language. I feel like an outsider here — like I wandered into a meeting where everyone knows the acronyms and I'm the only one who doesn't. That's not a good feeling when you're trying to give someone your business.
