## My Experience

### First Impressions — The Homepage

I opened launchpadlab.com with my magnifier set to about 300%. When the page loaded, my magnified viewport showed me only a small slice of the top-left corner of the screen. I could see part of the LaunchPad Lab logo — the blue rocket icon and the company name in dark text. That was reassuring; at least I knew I was in the right place.

I panned to the right to look for navigation. I found the start of the navigation bar: "Services" was the first link I encountered. Good — that's relevant to what I'm looking for. I continued panning right and found "Technologies," then "Industries," then "Our Work," "About Us," "Insights," and finally "Contact." The navigation links are arranged horizontally, and at my magnification level, I had to pan across the entire width of the header to read all seven items. It took effort, but the order was logical and I was able to build a mental map: services first, then more about the company, and contact at the end. That last item — "Contact" — is exactly what I need for my second goal, so I made a mental note.

Before clicking anything, I wanted to see what the homepage itself told me. I panned down from the header and hit the hero section. At 300%, the hero banner filled my entire viewport with a blue background and large white text. I could read the heading piece by piece: "AI Innovation." Then I panned down — "Digital Solutions." Then further — "Results that Matter." The line breaks in the heading actually worked well for me; each phrase was on its own line, large and readable against the blue.

Below the heading, I found a paragraph of descriptive text: "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth." That paragraph answered my first question almost immediately — I now had a clear sense that LaunchPad Lab is a consultancy that builds digital products with AI. The text was white on blue, and at my magnification it was perfectly readable.

Below that paragraph, I found a white button labeled "Connect with an Expert" — clearly a call-to-action to get in touch. I noted it but kept exploring.

### The Logo Scroller — Instant Confusion

I panned down and arrived at a section that said "Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses." Beneath that heading, I could see the edge of what looked like a client logo — but it was moving. The logos were scrolling horizontally, automatically, in an infinite loop. At my magnification, I could only see roughly one logo at a time, and they were sliding past at a speed that made it impossible to read any of them. I caught a glimpse of what looked like "Kawasaki" and "Harvard" but they slid away before I could be sure.

This was deeply frustrating. I wanted to see who LaunchPad Lab works with — it would help me understand if they're legitimate and if they work with organizations like mine. But the auto-scrolling animation made it completely unusable at my zoom level. There were no pause buttons, no way to stop the motion. I couldn't click on a logo or hover to pause. I just had to watch this blur of shapes drift past my magnified window. After about 15 seconds of trying, I gave up on the logo section and moved on.

I should note: my system does have "reduce motion" turned off because I generally find gentle transitions helpful for orientation. But this carousel was not gentle — it was a continuously moving conveyor belt of content that I simply could not access.

### Understanding Their Services — The Video and Text Section

Panning further down, I found a section with the subheading "Your Strategic AI Partner" and a larger heading "AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise." There was also a video embedded here (a Wistia player). I could see the video frame in my magnified view, but I'd need to pan away from the text to watch it, and pan back to read the description. The text and video were side by side, and at 300% they were in completely different "screens" for me.

I chose to focus on the text. The paragraph explained that LaunchPad Lab "combines deep expertise in product design and development with cutting-edge AI consulting to solve critical business challenges." This reinforced what I'd learned from the hero. Good. But the two-column layout meant I had to make a choice: read the text or look at the video. I couldn't see both at once, and I had to remember what I'd read while panning over to the video. This kind of spatial separation is always harder for me.

### Service Cards — Panning Through a Grid

Next I found a section titled "Driving ROI with AI" with the heading "Make AI Your Competitive Advantage." Below it were service cards arranged in what appeared to be a multi-column grid. At my zoom level, I could see one card at a time — maybe even just part of one card.

The first card I encountered was "AI Automation & Agentic AI" with the description "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce" and a "Learn More" link. I panned right and found "Web Application Development" — "Bespoke, redefining experiences." Then "Mobile Application Development," "Salesforce Development," "Product Strategy & Design," and "Managed Services & Support."

This section actually worked reasonably well for me. Each card had a clear heading (h3), a short description, and a link. Because I was panning one card at a time, the information was digestible in chunks. The headings were large enough to read, and the descriptions were concise.

However, I noticed something odd when I tried to interact with the cards. The entire card seemed to be wrapped in a link, but there was also a separate "Learn More" link inside the card. When I tabbed through with my keyboard, I was landing on both the outer card link and the inner "Learn More" link for the same destination. This was confusing — I wasn't sure if they went to different places or the same place. It felt like I was hitting the same thing twice.

### The Tabbed Section — A Disorienting Split

Then I reached a section that caused significant problems. It was titled "Problems We Solve" with the heading "Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast." Below that was a tabbed interface. On the left, I found tab labels: "Operational Efficiency," "Modern Technology," "Customer Engagement," "Scalable Solutions," "Expansive Resources," and "Speed to Market."

Here's the problem: the tab labels were on the left side of the page, and the tab content (which appeared to be an image) was on the right side. At 300% magnification, I could see the tab labels but not the content panel. I clicked "Operational Efficiency" and then had to pan far to the right to see the associated image. But the image had no alt text — it was just a visual with `alt=""`. So even after all that panning, I found... nothing meaningful. Just a decorative image with no text description.

I panned back left to try another tab — "Modern Technology" — and repeated the process. Same result: pan to the right, find an image with no description. The tab preview text ("Modernize legacy systems to improve overall performance and stability") was only visible within the left-side tab area, sandwiched below the tab button. At my magnification, I could see either the tab button OR the preview text, not both. So I had to pan down within the tab list to find the descriptive text, then remember it while panning right to see the (unhelpful) image.

This layout fundamentally assumes you can see both the tab labels and the content panel at the same time. I cannot. It was one of the most disorienting parts of the site.

### Statistics Section

After the tabs, I found a statistics section: "12+ Years in Business," "730+ Projects," "240+ Clients." Each stat had a short description. This section worked well for me — the numbers were large, the text was close to the numbers, and I could pan through them one at a time. The numbers seemed to animate (count up) as I scrolled into view, but at my magnification I mostly just saw the final numbers, which was fine.

### The Process Section — Dense but Navigable

Next was "Our Signature Approach" — "Accelerate Digital Product Speed to Market." This was a process grid with three phases: Discover, Deliver, and Release. Each phase had sub-steps. The text was organized in a logical left-to-right flow, and because it was primarily text content (headings h3 and h4 with short paragraphs), I could pan through it methodically. The white text on a dark blue background was high contrast and readable. This section was one of the better experiences on the page.

### AI Callout Section

Then came a callout: "Put AI to Work" — "Transform how your business operates with custom AI solutions." This had a nice, clean layout with text on one side and an SVG illustration on the other. The text was readable and the "Learn More" button was directly below the text block. The proximity of related elements was good here.

### Case Study Carousel — Lost in the Slider

The case study section was another carousel, this time for case studies (Prosci, CDK Global, Millennium Trust Company). Each case study slide was quite large, with a company logo, a heading, statistics, and a button. At my magnification, I could only see a small portion of one slide at a time.

The bigger problem was navigation. There were no visible previous/next controls (`controls: false` in the slider configuration). The only way to move between slides was by mouse-dragging, and the slides used `autoWidth: true`, which meant parts of adjacent slides were peeking in at the edges. At 300% zoom, I couldn't tell where one slide ended and another began. I could see the Prosci case study data (5,400+ Current Users, 3,200+ Unique Projects Created, 30+ Countries) but had no idea there were other case studies until I accidentally dragged the slider.

### Awards Section

Below the case studies was another auto-scrolling logo section, this time showing award badges. These images had completely empty alt text — `alt=""` — so I had no idea what these awards were for. The scrolling animation again made it impossible to examine any single badge at my zoom level.

## Finding Contact Information — The Contact Page

### Navigating to Contact

I remembered the "Contact" link from the top navigation. I panned back up to the header and found the navigation. I clicked "Contact" and the page loaded.

### The Contact Page Header

The contact page opened with a blue header: "Ready to Build Something Great?" with the text "Complete the form below to tell us about your project. We will get in touch with you as soon as possible." Clear and direct. I knew exactly what to do.

### The Contact Form

Below the header, I found a contact form. The form had a section header: "Reach Out" / "Ready to Build Something Great?" / "Partner with us to develop technology to grow your business." Then the form fields began.

The form fields were:
1. **First Name** (required)
2. **Last Name** (required)
3. **Company Email** (required)
4. **Company** (required)
5. **How Can We Help You?** (textarea, required)
6. **reCAPTCHA**
7. **Submit button**

The labels were positioned above the inputs, which was helpful — I could see the label and the input field together in my magnified view without panning. That's a good design choice for magnifier users.

However, the first four fields used a `half-width` layout, meaning First Name and Last Name were side by side, and Company Email and Company were side by side. At 300% magnification, I could only see one field at a time. I filled in my First Name, then tabbed — and the focus jumped to Last Name, which was on the right side of the page. I had to pan right to see it. Then after filling in Last Name, tabbing took me to Company Email on the next row (left side), which meant panning back left. Then tabbing again took me to Company (right side), requiring another pan to the right.

This left-right-left-right zigzag pattern was manageable because I was using the keyboard to tab between fields, and each field had its label directly above it. But it was still extra work compared to a single-column layout where I could just move straight down.

The "How Can We Help You?" textarea was full-width, which was a welcome change — I could see the label and the text area together.

Then came the reCAPTCHA. This is always a challenge with a magnifier. The reCAPTCHA widget appeared as a small checkbox with "I'm not a robot" text. At 300%, the checkbox target was manageable, but I was worried it might trigger an image challenge (select all squares with traffic lights, etc.) — those puzzles are extremely difficult at high magnification because I can't see the full grid of images at once.

The Submit button was below the reCAPTCHA, which was fine — I found it by panning down. But there was significant vertical distance between the last text field ("How Can We Help You?") and the Submit button because of the reCAPTCHA element in between. I had to scroll past the reCAPTCHA to find Submit.

### Contact Cards Below the Form

After the form, I discovered three cards with additional contact methods:
- **Email**: contact@launchpadlab.com
- **Call**: (312) 888-9651
- **Connect with Us on LinkedIn**: with a "Connect" link

These were in a three-column layout, so I had to pan horizontally to find each one. The email card was on the left, phone in the middle, and LinkedIn on the right. I would have preferred these to be stacked vertically or placed prominently near the top of the page, before the form. If I'd just wanted to call them, I'd have had to scroll past the entire form to find the phone number.

### The Footer — Another Source of Contact Info

I also checked the footer, where I found a second instance of the phone number and their physical address: "2045 W Grand Ave Ste B, PMB 37406, Chicago, Illinois 60612." The footer was laid out in three columns. At 300%, I had to pan across each column separately. The first column had the company description and navigation links. The second had "Contact Us" with the address and phone. The third had "Let's Get Social" with Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn links.

The social media links had icons with empty alt text next to text labels ("Facebook," "Instagram," "LinkedIn"). The text labels were helpful — without them, the icons alone would have been meaningless at my zoom level (I'd just see a small, unrecognizable shape).

## Attempting the Mega Menu — A Major Barrier

Before leaving, I want to describe my experience with the Services mega menu, because it was one of the biggest obstacles. When I hovered over "Services" in the navigation, a massive dropdown appeared. This mega menu was organized in a 12-column grid with three groups of submenu items plus a promotional text block.

At 300% magnification, the mega menu extended far beyond my visible viewport. I could see "AI Automation" and "Web App Development" in the first column, but to see the other columns I had to move my mouse to pan — and as soon as my cursor left the menu area, the menu closed. I tried multiple times to explore the full Services dropdown, and each time it collapsed before I could read all the items.

The menu is configured to use `hover_intent` with a 300ms timeout. That means if my mouse leaves the menu area for more than 300 milliseconds — which happens constantly when I'm panning my magnified view — the menu disappears. For someone using a screen magnifier, this timeout is far too short. I essentially could not use the Services mega menu to browse individual service pages.

I eventually gave up on the mega menu and clicked the "Services" link directly, which took me to the main services page. But I missed the ability to directly navigate to specific service sub-pages from the navigation.

## Summary

### What Worked
- **Hero section text**: Large, high-contrast, logically ordered. I could understand what LaunchPad Lab does just from reading the hero.
- **Clear heading hierarchy**: The h1, h2, h3 structure helped me understand page sections as I panned through them.
- **Contact form label placement**: Labels above inputs kept related elements close together.
- **Statistics section**: Numbers and descriptions were proximate and clear.
- **Process grid section**: Text-heavy, logically ordered, high contrast — the best section for magnifier use.
- **"Connect with an Expert" CTA in hero**: Easily discoverable, clearly labeled.
- **Skip link present**: The site has a skip-to-content link, though I couldn't verify if its target anchor actually exists.

### What Didn't Work
- **Auto-scrolling logo carousels**: Impossible to read at magnification. No pause controls.
- **Mega menu with hover intent**: Closes before I can explore all items. The 300ms timeout is hostile to magnifier users who need to pan.
- **Two-column form layout**: The zigzag panning pattern for half-width fields added unnecessary effort.
- **Tabbed interface with spatial separation**: Tab labels on the left, content on the right — unusable when you can't see both at once. Tab content images have no alt text.
- **Case study carousel without visible controls**: No way to discover or navigate between slides reliably.
- **Contact methods buried below the form**: Phone number and email are only accessible after scrolling past the entire form.
- **Empty alt text on informational images**: Award badges, tab content images, and some icons provide no information.
- **Nested links in service cards**: Confusing duplicate focus targets when tabbing.
- **AOS fade-in animations**: Content that pops in unexpectedly as I scroll can be disorienting.

### Were My Goals Achieved?

**Goal 1 — Find what LaunchPad Lab does**: Yes. The hero text, the service cards, and the process section all communicated clearly that LaunchPad Lab is an AI-focused digital product consultancy. This information was accessible through my magnifier, though it required significant panning.

**Goal 2 — Find how to contact them**: Yes, but with unnecessary difficulty. I could reach the Contact page via the top navigation and fill out the form. However, the two-column field layout and the reCAPTCHA created extra friction. I also found the phone number and email, but only after scrolling past the entire form.

### Would I Leave the Site?

I came close to leaving during the mega menu interaction and during the logo carousel. Both were disorienting enough that I felt the site wasn't designed with people like me in mind. But I persisted because the core text content — headings, descriptions, CTAs — was actually quite good. If the layout were more linear and the interactive components more forgiving, this site would be significantly more usable with a screen magnifier.
