## My Experience

### First Impressions

I opened the website, and the first thing I saw was a big headline that said **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."** I don't really know what "AI Innovation" means. I've heard of AI, but "innovation" is a big word and I'm not sure what they're doing with it. "Digital Solutions" is also confusing — a solution to what? It doesn't tell me what this company actually *does* in a way I can understand.

Underneath the headline there was a paragraph that said LaunchPad Lab "helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services" and that they "build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth." I had to read this two or three times. Words like "harness," "tailored consulting," "product development services," "modernize operations," and "unlock growth" — these are not everyday words for me. I still wasn't sure if they build websites, or apps, or something else. I understood they do something with computers and AI, but I couldn't put it in my own words.

The button below said **"Connect with an Expert."** I appreciate that it's a clear action, but "expert" feels a little intimidating. I wasn't sure if clicking it would call someone or take me to a form.

### Trying to Understand What They Do

I looked at the navigation at the top. The main menu items were **Services, Technologies, Industries, Our Work, About Us, Insights, Contact.** I know what "Contact" means, and "About Us" makes sense. But "Technologies," "Industries," and "Insights" are vague to me. "Insights" — insights about what? I wouldn't click that because I don't know where it would take me.

I hovered over **"Services"** and a big dropdown appeared with six options:
- AI Automation
- Web App Development
- Mobile App Development
- Salesforce Development
- Product Strategy & Design
- Managed Services & Support

Each one had a small icon next to it. The icons had empty `alt` text and were marked as decorative, so they don't help me understand what the service is. The icon next to "AI Automation" looked like a person — I don't know why that represents AI. The icon next to "Web App Development" looked like code brackets — I don't know what that means. None of the icons helped me.

The dropdown also had text that said: "Our cross-functional teams have the skills and experience to support the full digital product lifecycle, using proven methods to deliver more better and faster with AI at the core." This sentence is very long and has words I don't understand: "cross-functional teams," "full digital product lifecycle," "proven methods." I think there's also a grammar mistake — "deliver more better" — which confused me more. I thought I was reading it wrong.

I also saw a second dropdown for **"Industries"** listing Financial Services, Healthcare, Professional Services, Insurance, Technology, Legal, Private Equity, Education, Social Impact. This was a lot of categories to scan through. The description said they "build AI-focused digital products that deliver results for businesses in all industries." I was still stuck on what a "digital product" actually is.

I scrolled down the homepage and found a section called **"Your Strategic AI Partner"** with the heading **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."** The word "enterprise" means a big business, I think, but I'm not sure if this company helps regular people or small businesses too. The text said they "combine deep expertise in product design and development with cutting-edge AI consulting to solve critical business challenges." This is a long, complicated sentence. "Deep expertise," "cutting-edge," "AI consulting," "critical business challenges" — none of these are plain language.

Further down, I found a section called **"Make AI Your Competitive Advantage"** where they listed their six services again as cards:
1. **AI Automation & Agentic AI** — "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce." I don't know what "agentic" means, and "autonomous digital workforce" sounds like robots, but I'm not sure.
2. **Web Application Development** — "Bespoke, redefining experiences." "Bespoke" is a word I've seen but I don't really know what it means. I think it means custom?
3. **Mobile Application Development** — "Meeting users where they are." This was the clearest one. I think they make phone apps.
4. **Salesforce Development** — "Solving business problems." I don't know what Salesforce is.
5. **Product Strategy & Design** — "Agile, cross-functional expertise." More jargon. I don't know what "agile" means in this context.
6. **Managed Services & Support** — "Operating as an extension of your team." This one was sort of understandable.

Each card had a "Learn More" link, but there were also *two* "Learn More" links on each card — I wasn't sure if they went to the same place or different places. That was confusing.

### The Tab Section

There was a section with tabs labeled **Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement, Scalable Solutions, Expansive Resources, Speed to Market.** I clicked on a couple. The text inside each tab was short, which was nice, but the tab labels themselves are business jargon. "Scalable Solutions" and "Expansive Resources" don't mean anything to me. I don't understand what problem they solve for me.

### Numbers and Statistics

I saw big numbers: **12+ Years in Business, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients.** This was actually easy to understand. Numbers are clear. I could tell they've been around a long time and work with a lot of people. This was one of the parts I felt confident about.

### The Process Section

There was a section called **"Accelerate Digital Product Speed to Market"** with steps: Discover, Deliver, Release. Each had sub-steps like "Research & Define," "Development," "QA Testing," "Deploy," "Ongoing Support." This was a lot of steps to follow and the terms are technical. I tried to understand the flow but it felt like it was meant for someone who already knows how software projects work, not for someone like me who is just trying to figure out what they do.

### Finding Contact Information

I looked for "Contact" in the top navigation and found it easily — it's the last item in the menu bar, and it's always in the same place on every page. That was good. When I clicked it, I was taken to the contact page.

The contact page had a heading **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** and said to "Complete the form below to tell us about your project." But when I looked for the form, it wasn't there. Instead I saw a notice that said **"Notice: JavaScript is required for this content."** I don't know what JavaScript is. I don't know how to make it work. The form just wasn't showing for me, or it looked broken. This was very frustrating because this was the main thing I needed to do.

I scrolled down further and found a section with testimonials from past clients. These were nice to see — real people saying good things — but they didn't help me contact the company.

Finally, at the very bottom of the contact page, I found:
- **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com
- **Call:** (312) 888-9651
- **Connect with Us on LinkedIn**

I also found the same phone number and address in the footer:
- **2045 W Grand Ave Ste B, PMB 37406, Chicago, Illinois 60612**
- **(312) 888-9651**

So I *could* contact them by phone or email, which is great. But the main contact form didn't work, and I felt like I was supposed to use it.

### Consistency Across Pages

I checked a few different pages — the homepage, the about page, the services page, and the contact page. The navigation stayed the same at the top, which was good. The footer was the same too. The overall look of the site was consistent, which helped me know where I was.

However, the way they invite you to contact them changed from page to page. On the homepage it says **"Connect with an Expert"** and also **"Let's Build Something Great. Get in touch with one of our experts today!"** On the contact page it says **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** and the footer says **"Let's Get Social."** On the about page it says **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** again. The phrasing changes, which makes me second-guess whether these all lead to the same place.

### The About Page

The about page said LaunchPad Lab is "a digital product firm that builds high-impact digital products that drive business results." This is the same kind of language as the homepage. They describe themselves as having "Holistic Capability," being "On the Cutting Edge," and having "Deep Experience." These are catchy phrases but they don't explain things in simple terms.

They listed their leadership team with names and titles like "Co Founder & CEO," "Partner, President, & Head of Sales," "Co Founder & CTO," "VP of Design," "Principal Software Architect II," "Engineering Manager." These titles don't mean much to me. I don't know what a CTO does or what a "Principal Software Architect II" is.

### The Services Page

The services page repeated a lot of the same jargon. It had a section about "Business," "IT," and "Users" problems they solve. The "Users" section was the easiest: "Enjoy a quick, modern, intuitive experience that adds value for them." I could understand that.

There was also a section called **"Discovery Space Navigator"** that said "Too many teams waste time building something that doesn't add value. Discovery Space Navigator changes that in three simple steps." This name is confusing — I imagined something about outer space. It's a tool name, but it doesn't describe what it does clearly.

The FAQ section at the bottom of the services page was actually helpful. The questions were in plain enough language: "How much does it cost to build a custom software solution?" and "How long does it take to build a digital product?" The answers were long but more understandable than the rest of the site.

### The Mobile Menu

On my phone or in a smaller window, the navigation turned into a hamburger button (three lines). The button had an `aria-label` that said "Toggle Menu," but there was no visible word "Menu" next to it. I know what the three lines mean because my family member taught me, but if I forgot, I wouldn't know what to tap. A visible word "Menu" would help me.

### Animations

Some content faded in as I scrolled (fade-up animations). This was a little disorienting — I wasn't sure if I had missed something or if the page was still loading. I prefer when everything is just there and doesn't move around.

## Did I Achieve My Goals?

### Goal 1: Find what LaunchPad Lab does
**Partially.** After spending a long time on the site, I gathered that they build apps, websites, and do something with AI and Salesforce for businesses. But I couldn't find a single simple sentence that explains this in plain language. Everything used words like "digital products," "AI-powered solutions," "cross-functional teams," "bespoke," "agentic AI," and "full-stack." I would not be able to explain to my family what this company does.

### Goal 2: Find how to contact them
**Partially.** The contact form did not work — it showed a message about JavaScript. But I did find a phone number **(312) 888-9651** and an email **contact@launchpadlab.com** at the bottom of the contact page and in the footer of every page. I could call or email them.

---

## Would I Have Left the Site?

**Yes, I think I would have left after the homepage.** The language was overwhelming. Almost every section used words I don't understand, and there was no plain-language summary anywhere. I felt like this site was not made for someone like me. If my family member wasn't helping me, I would have given up after reading the first few paragraphs and not understanding what the company does.

The broken contact form would have been the final frustration. If I couldn't call or didn't notice the phone number at the bottom, I would have just closed the tab.

## What Worked Well

- The **"Contact"** link is clearly labeled and in a consistent position in the navigation.
- The **phone number and email** are available in the footer on every page.
- The **statistics** (12+ years, 730+ projects, 240+ clients) were easy to understand.
- The **navigation layout is consistent** across all pages.
- The **footer structure** is the same everywhere.
- Social media links in the footer have visible text labels ("Facebook," "Instagram," "LinkedIn") next to their icons.
- The site has a **"Skip to content"** link.

## What Did Not Work

- Almost all text uses **business jargon and technical language** without plain-language alternatives.
- The **contact form requires JavaScript** and shows an unhelpful error message if it doesn't load.
- The **hamburger menu icon has no visible "Menu" label** — only an aria-label.
- **CTA phrasing changes** across pages ("Connect with an Expert," "Let's Build Something Great," "Ready to Build Something Great," "Reach Out," "Let's Connect") making it hard to know what each will do.
- The **service descriptions are abstract** and don't explain what the company does in everyday terms.
- **Duplicate "Learn More" links** on service cards are confusing.
- **Animations** (fade-up effects) are disorienting.
- The **mega dropdown menu** has too much content and complex descriptions.
