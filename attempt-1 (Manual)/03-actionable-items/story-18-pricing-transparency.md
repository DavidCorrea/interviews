# Story 18: Add Pricing Transparency

## User Story

**As a** potential client evaluating the company,
**I want** to see at least general pricing guidance or an explanation of how pricing works,
**So that** I can determine if the company fits my budget before contacting them.

## Description

No pricing information or even ballpark ranges are provided anywhere. Everything requires "contact us." This feels like a pressure tactic and creates suspicion among cautious users.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least one of the following is present on the site:
  - General pricing ranges (e.g., "Projects typically start at $X")
  - A pricing tiers page
  - An FAQ explaining how pricing works and what factors affect cost
- [ ] A free, no-obligation consultation is clearly offered
- [ ] Pricing/cost information is easy to find (linked from main navigation or service pages)

## Testing Instructions

1. **Content check:** Navigate the site looking for pricing information — it should be findable within 2 clicks from the homepage
2. **FAQ:** If a pricing FAQ exists, verify it answers: "How much does a project cost?", "What factors affect pricing?", and "Is there a minimum project size?"
3. **Consultation offer:** Verify a free consultation is clearly offered with "no obligation" language
4. **User test:** Ask a potential client persona to find pricing info — they should locate it within 60 seconds
