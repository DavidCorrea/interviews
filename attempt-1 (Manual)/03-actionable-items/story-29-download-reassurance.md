# Story 29: Add Reassurance and Context to Downloads

## User Story

**As a** cautious or less tech-savvy user,
**I want** download links to clearly describe what I'm downloading and reassure me it's safe,
**So that** I feel confident clicking them without fear of viruses or scams.

## Description

"Download Our Guide" links trigger fear of viruses and scams among less tech-savvy or cautious users. There is no reassurance about the safety or nature of the download.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Download links include the file type and size (e.g., "Download Our Free PDF Guide (2.3 MB)")
- [ ] Reassurance text is present near download links (e.g., "Safe download — no signup required")
- [ ] Download links open or save the file directly (no unexpected redirects or popups)
- [ ] Where possible, content is offered as a web page alternative alongside the download

## Testing Instructions

1. **Link text:** Review all download links across the site — verify each includes file type and size
2. **Reassurance:** Verify reassurance text appears near each download link
3. **Click test:** Click a download link — verify it directly downloads or opens a PDF without redirects or popups
4. **Web alternative:** Check if a web-page version of the downloadable content is also available
5. **User test:** Ask a less tech-savvy person if they'd feel comfortable clicking the download link — their response should be positive
