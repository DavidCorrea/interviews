## My Experience Browsing the Site (Real-Time Reactions)

Okay so I just opened the website and WOW there's like... everything happening at once. 

First thing I see: "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." Cool cool cool, so they do... AI stuff? Tech stuff? Wait there's a button - "Connect with an Expert" - should I click that now? No wait, I need to figure out what they do first.

Oh look, logos! Harvard, Northwestern, 1-800-GOT-JUNK... wait that junk removal company uses them? Interesting. Oh but there are SO MANY LOGOS. Like 12 of them. My eyes are just bouncing around. Okay moving on.

Scrolling down... "Your Strategic AI Partner" - another big headline. Okay so AI is definitely their thing. But then there's this whole paragraph underneath and I'm like... *skims* "deep expertise... cutting-edge AI consulting... critical business challenges..." yeah yeah I'm getting the vibe, they're consultants or something.

OH! Six boxes with different services! Let me read these:
- AI Automation & Agentic AI (wait what's agentic?)
- Web Application Development 
- Mobile Application Development
- Salesforce Development
- Product Strategy & Design
- Managed Services & Support

Each one has a "Learn More" button. That's SIX buttons. Which one do I click?? I'm just staring at them. Do I need to click all of them? That seems like a lot. I'm just gonna keep scrolling for now.

"Problems We Solve" - okay this section has like 6 MORE boxes with "Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement..." I'm honestly starting to lose track of what's what. There are so many sections. Everything looks kind of the same? Like pretty colors and icons but it's all blurring together.

Wait, numbers! "12+ Years in Business, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients" - okay THAT I can process. They've been around a while, they've done a lot of stuff. Good to know.

Oh god there's a whole section about "Our Signature Approach" with Discover, Deliver, Release... and under each one there are MORE subsections. "Research & Define, Align on scope, priorities, including outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept" - my eyes just glazed over. Too many words. Skipping.

More scrolling... case studies! Pictures! Those are easier. I see Prosci did something with Salesforce, CDK Global did a sales thing, some company made a million dollars. Cool. But wait, should I click on these? Are these important? I'm getting overwhelmed.

Oh there are AWARDS now? A bunch of badge images. Top Clutch company, AI consulting, Ruby on Rails... okay they're legit, got it.

"Related Content" - three more things I could click on. Blog posts and downloads. Honestly at this point I'm exhausted and I still don't have a clear answer about what they DO exactly and where to contact them.

Wait, at the very bottom: "Reach Out - Let's Build Something Great." FINALLY. But wait, it just says "Get in touch with one of our experts today!" - where's the actual contact info?? Do I have to click something?

*clicks to contact page*

Okay new page loaded. "Ready to Build Something Great?" Uh, maybe? "Complete the form below to tell us about your project" - oh no, a FORM. I have to fill out a form. That's going to take forever and I'll probably forget what I wanted to ask by the time I'm done.

But wait! I'm scrolling past all these testimonials (they're long, I'm skipping them) and... YES! "Let's Connect" section with actual contact info!

**Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
**Phone:** (312) 888-9651  
**LinkedIn:** There's a link

THANK GOD. I can just email or call them instead of filling out a form.

## What Does This Company Do?

Okay so based on my speed-reading and skimming (because let's be real, I didn't read every word), here's what I THINK they do:

LaunchPad Lab is like a tech company that builds stuff for other companies. They're really into AI right now - that's mentioned like everywhere. 

They do:
1. **AI automation stuff** - helping businesses automate things with AI agents (which I guess are like AI workers?)
2. **Build websites and apps** - both web and mobile
3. **Salesforce things** - I don't know exactly what Salesforce is but they work with it
4. **Design and strategy** - planning out products before building them
5. **Ongoing support** - they stick around after they build something

They've been around since 2012, worked with big names like Harvard and hospitals and corporations. They seem legit.

The main vibe I got: they help businesses modernize and automate using AI and custom software. They build apps, portals, systems - whatever a business needs. And they're REALLY pushing the AI angle hard.

Honestly though? The site threw SO MUCH INFO at me that I'm like 70% confident in this answer. There was just too much to process and I definitely missed details.

## Where and How to Contact Them

**Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
**Phone:** (312) 888-9651  
**LinkedIn:** They have a company page

There's also a contact form on their website but honestly I'd rather just email or call. Forms stress me out because I have to fill out multiple fields and I always worry I'm going to forget something or write the wrong thing.

The phone number is Chicago area code (312) which is cool, they're US-based.

## My Summary as an ADHD User

### 1. What Distracted Me

- **ALL THE LOGOS:** There were 12 company logos in a row near the top. My eyes just kept bouncing between them. Harvard! Whirlpool! MD Anderson! It was like visual ping-pong.

- **Six service boxes with "Learn More" buttons:** Every single box had icons, headlines, descriptions, AND a button. I didn't know which to focus on. Should I click them all? Just one? None? Decision paralysis.

- **The case study images:** There were these colorful interface screenshots that kept catching my eye. I'd be reading something and then BAM, a pretty picture would pull my attention away.

- **Award badges:** At one point there were like 7 award badges in a row. My brain was like "ooh shiny images" and I completely lost track of what I was reading before that.

- **Multiple "Learn More" / "View Case Study" / "Connect" buttons:** There must have been 20+ clickable buttons on the homepage alone. Every section had buttons. My cursor was hovering everywhere not knowing where to click first.

- **Too many sections:** The page just kept going and going. Every time I thought I was done, there was another section. "Oh here's our approach... oh here are case studies... oh here are awards... oh here's related content..." I lost track of where I was.

- **The testimonials on the contact page:** They were these long quotes from different people. I started reading one and halfway through I forgot why I was on the page.

### 2. Where I Lost Focus

- **The long paragraph under "Your Strategic AI Partner":** It started with "At LaunchPad Lab, we combine deep expertise..." and just kept going. My eyes glazed over after the first sentence. Too dense, too business-y, too many big words strung together.

- **The "Our Signature Approach" section:** It had these steps (Discover, Deliver, Release) and under each step there were bullet points with even MORE details. "Align on scope, priorities, including outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept" - by the time I got to "proof of concept" I'd forgotten what the beginning of the sentence was about.

- **The "Problems We Solve" section:** There were 6 different problems listed with descriptions. After reading 2-3 of them, they all started sounding the same in my head. "Streamline this, modernize that, enhance the other thing..." I couldn't keep them straight.

- **Case study details:** When I clicked on the AI automation page, there were these detailed case studies with statistics and explanations. I tried to read one and got bored halfway through. Too much detail for my brain to hold onto.

- **The FAQ section:** By the time I got to "Frequently Asked Questions" at the bottom of a page, I was so mentally exhausted that I just scrolled past them. Even though they might have answered my questions, I couldn't make myself read more paragraphs.

- **Trying to figure out the difference between their services:** They list AI Automation, Web Dev, Mobile Dev, Salesforce, Product Strategy, Managed Services... I kept trying to understand how these are different and how they relate to each other and my brain just gave up. Too many categories.

### 3. Where Instructions Were Too Long

- **The description under each service:** Like "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce" under AI Automation. Then when you click for more details, there's even LONGER descriptions with multiple paragraphs. Just tell me in one simple sentence what you do!

- **The "What We Do" sections:** On the AI automation page, there's a section called "What We Do" and then it has a paragraph explaining their approach, PLUS 5 sub-services, EACH with their own description. That's like... 6 layers of information. Way too much.

- **The homepage intro paragraph:** "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth." That's TWO long sentences with like 10 concepts. Just say "We build AI-powered software for businesses" and move on!

- **The process descriptions:** "Align on scope, priorities, including outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept" - that's a list within a description within a process step. My brain can't handle nested information like that.

- **Case study text:** The case studies had paragraphs explaining the challenge, the solution, the approach, the results... I just wanted bullet points or a quick summary. Give me the highlights!

- **The testimonials:** Some of those client quotes were 3-4 sentences long. After the first sentence, my eyes start wandering to other parts of the page.

### 4. What Would Make It Easier

**✅ PUT THE CONTACT INFO AT THE TOP**  
Seriously, just put the phone number and email in the header where I can always see it. I shouldn't have to scroll to the bottom of the homepage and then click to another page and then scroll again to find it.

**✅ ONE CLEAR HEADLINE**  
Just tell me immediately: "We build custom AI software for businesses." Done. Don't make me piece it together from 6 different service boxes and 3 different taglines.

**✅ FEWER CHOICES**  
Instead of 6 service boxes, maybe have 2-3 main categories? My brain shuts down when there are too many options. Like maybe "AI Solutions" and "Custom Software" and "Support" - that's it.

**✅ BULLET POINTS INSTEAD OF PARAGRAPHS**  
Any description longer than 2 sentences should be bullet points. I can scan bullet points. I can't focus on paragraph after paragraph.

**✅ CLEAR VISUAL HIERARCHY**  
Right now everything looks equally important - every section has a big headline and colorful boxes. I don't know what to read first. Make the most important info REALLY stand out and the less important stuff smaller/simpler.

**✅ LESS SCROLLING**  
The homepage is SO LONG. Can some of this be on different pages? Or hidden behind a "Read More" toggle? I got exhausted scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.

**✅ STATIC IMAGES, NO ANIMATIONS**  
If there are any animations or moving elements (I couldn't tell from the text version), please no. Movement is my kryptonite. I will stare at it and forget what I'm supposed to be doing.

**✅ ONE CALL-TO-ACTION AT A TIME**  
Don't give me 6 "Learn More" buttons in a row. Give me ONE clear next step. Like "Want to learn about our services? Click here." Then on that next page, give me ONE next step. Guide me through step by step.

**✅ VISUAL BREAKS**  
Use more white space between sections. Right now everything feels crammed together. Give my eyes (and brain) a rest between chunks of information.

**✅ SIMPLE LANGUAGE**  
Words like "agentic," "bespoke," "cross-functional," "bi-weekly sprint releases" - these make my brain work too hard. Use everyday words. "Custom-made," "team-based," "we release updates every two weeks" - see? Easier.

**✅ A PROGRESS INDICATOR**  
If the page is going to be long, show me how far I've scrolled or how many sections there are. Like "Section 1 of 5" so I know what I'm in for.

**✅ SKIP NAVIGATION**  
Put a menu at the top that lets me jump directly to "Services" or "Contact" or "About" without scrolling through everything.

**✅ TLDR SUMMARIES**  
For any section with lots of details, put a 1-sentence summary at the top. Like "TLDR: We automate business processes using AI agents." Then if I want more info, I can keep reading. But at least I got the main idea.

## Final Thoughts

Look, I KNOW these folks probably do great work. They've worked with Harvard and big hospitals and they've been around for over a decade. The information is all there.

But holy crap, my brain was FRIED by the time I found the contact info.

There's just SO MUCH happening on every page. Too many choices, too many buttons, too much text, too many sections. I kept getting distracted by new images and buttons and logos and I'd forget what I was looking for.

If I actually needed to hire a company like this, I'd probably call them directly (since I eventually found the phone number) instead of trying to navigate the website. The site made me feel overwhelmed and scattered - which isn't great when you're trying to make a good impression.

**My rating: 4/10 for ADHD-friendliness**

The info is there, but it's buried under too many layers and too many distractions. Simplify, prioritize, and for the love of god, put the contact info where I can see it immediately!
