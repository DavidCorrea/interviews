# Cognitive Disability Tester Report

## Persona

My name is Michael Torres. I'm 32 years old. I have mild cognitive processing difficulties. This means I need more time to understand information. When there's too much at once, I get confused. Long sentences are hard for me. I have to read them many times. Big words I don't know make me feel lost. When websites have too many choices, I don't know what to pick. I get stressed.

---

## Browsing Experience

I opened the website. Right away, I saw big text that says "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."

I don't know what this means. What is AI Innovation? What are Digital Solutions? This is confusing already.

Then there's a long paragraph. It says: "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."

I read it. I don't understand. Too many big words.
- "harness the power" - what does this mean?
- "tailored consulting" - what?
- "product development services" - I don't know
- "high-impact digital products" - too complicated
- "modernize operations" - what operations?
- "unlock growth" - unlock?

I feel frustrated. The website just started and I already don't understand what they do.

There's a blue button. It says "Connect with an Expert." Okay, that's clear. I could click that if I need help.

I keep looking. There are many company logos. Harvard. Northwestern. Hospitals. Big companies. Okay, so they work with big places. That's good to know.

Then another section. "Your Strategic AI Partner" and "AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."

More words I don't understand:
- "Strategic" - what does this mean for a partner?
- "AI-Powered" - powered by AI? How?
- "Modern Enterprise" - is this a type of business?

There's a long paragraph again: "At LaunchPad Lab, we combine deep expertise in product design and development with cutting-edge AI consulting to solve critical business challenges. We've helped hundreds of businesses across all industries solve complex problems that go beyond just ROI. Whether you're just getting started with AI or scaling adoption across your organization, our cross-functional teams partner with you to deliver results."

I try to read it. My head hurts. So many complicated words:
- "deep expertise" 
- "cutting-edge"
- "critical business challenges"
- "ROI" - what are these letters?
- "scaling adoption"
- "cross-functional teams"

I still don't know what they do. Do they fix computers? Do they make websites? I'm confused.

Now there are six boxes. Each box has a title:
1. AI Automation & Agentic AI
2. Web Application Development
3. Mobile Application Development
4. Salesforce Development
5. Product Strategy & Design
6. Managed Services & Support

That's a lot of choices! I don't know which one to look at. And what is "Agentic AI"? That doesn't sound like a real word.

Each box has more text under the title:
- "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce" - I don't understand this
- "Bespoke, redefining experiences" - what is bespoke?
- "Meeting users where they are" - this one makes more sense
- "Solving business problems" - okay, this is clear
- "Agile, cross-functional expertise" - complicated again
- "Operating as an extension of your team" - extension?

Every box has a button that says "Learn More." But there are six of them. If I click one, what happens? Will I lose this page? I'm worried I'll get lost.

I keep scrolling. More sections.

"Problems We Solve" - okay, this might help me understand.

But then it says "Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast" and a long paragraph about "forging a partnership rather than a mere service agreement" and "bespoke" again and "deeply aligned with your strategic goals."

Too many words. I'm getting tired.

There are more boxes. Six more:
1. Operational Efficiency
2. Modern Technology
3. Customer Engagement
4. Scalable Solutions
5. Expansive Resources
6. Speed to Market

Each one has a description. More big words:
- "Streamline processes" - what does streamline mean?
- "Modernize legacy systems" - legacy?
- "UI/UX" - what are these letters?
- "CSAT" - more letters I don't know
- "Scalable" - I don't know this word

I'm feeling overwhelmed. Twelve boxes total so far. So much information. My brain is tired.

Now there are numbers:
- 12+ Years in Business
- 730+ Projects
- 240+ Clients

Okay! Numbers are easier. They've been working for 12 years. They've done 730 projects. They have 240 clients. This I understand.

Another section: "Our Signature Approach"

It has three parts: Discover, Deliver, Release.

Under each part, there are smaller sections with bullet points. Let me try to read:

Under "Discover":
- "Research & Define: Align on scope, priorities, including outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept."

This sentence has too many things. Scope, priorities, outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, proof of concept. That's seven different things in one sentence. I can't remember all of them. Which one is important?

Under "Deliver":
- "Development: Build iteratively with bi-weekly sprint releases. Sync and demo weekly with client."
- "QA Testing: UAT validation ensures nothing goes unchecked and everything functions properly."

What is "iteratively"? What is "bi-weekly sprint releases"? What is "UAT validation"? I don't know any of these words.

Under "Release":
- "Deploy: Ship the product to market – with a seamless handoff to drive adoption and deliver results."
- "Ongoing Support: Monitor metrics and performance. Enhance features and address issues as needed."

"Deploy," "seamless handoff," "drive adoption," "monitor metrics" - all confusing.

This section told me their process has three steps, but I don't actually understand what happens in each step. The words are too complicated.

More scrolling. Case studies. Company names and numbers. "360-Customer View in Salesforce" - I don't know what this means.

Awards. Lots of pictures of awards. Okay, they won awards. That's good.

Blog posts at the bottom. The titles are long:
- "The Business Value of Building Applications and Portals"
- "Download Our Guide: Building Your Competitive Advantage With Salesforce"
- "How Automated Intelligence Is Reshaping the Way Businesses Scale"

These titles have too many words. I don't know if I should read them.

Finally, at the very bottom: "Reach Out - Let's Build Something Great. Get in touch with one of our experts today!"

But how? Where's the phone number? Where's the email?

I click on "Connect with an Expert" because I remember seeing that button earlier.

A new page loads. The title says "Ready to Build Something Great?"

It says "Complete the form below to tell us about your project."

Oh no. A form. I have to fill out information. What if I make a mistake? What if they ask questions I don't understand? I'm nervous about forms.

I scroll down. There are long quotes from people. They're saying nice things about the company. But the quotes are very long. Two, three, four sentences each. I start reading one and forget the beginning by the time I reach the end.

I keep scrolling.

Finally! "Let's Connect"

I see:
- **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com
- **Call:** (312) 888-9651
- **Connect with Us on Linkedin**

Okay! These are clear. A phone number and an email. This is what I needed.

But it took so long to find. And I still don't really understand what the company does.

## What Does This Company Do?

After looking at the whole website, here's what I think:

LaunchPad Lab makes computer things for businesses.

They talked about:
- AI (computer brains that think?)
- Making websites
- Making phone apps
- Something called Salesforce (I think this is computer software for businesses)
- Helping plan projects
- Helping after they finish making something

They've been working for 12 years. They worked with big companies like Harvard and hospitals.

I think... they help businesses use computers better? They make custom computer programs?

But I'm not 100% sure. The website used so many complicated words that I couldn't understand exactly what they do.

If someone asked me "What does LaunchPad Lab do?" I would say: "They do computer work for companies. They make websites and apps. They help with AI."

But I don't feel confident about this answer. The website made me feel confused.

## How to Contact Them

**Phone number:** (312) 888-9651

**Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com

**LinkedIn:** They have a page on LinkedIn (there's a link)

These are on the Contact page.

There's also a form you can fill out on the Contact page, but I didn't try it because forms make me nervous.

The phone number and email are clear and easy. I would call them if I needed to talk to someone.

## Summary

### 1. Overwhelming Sections

**The Six Service Boxes:**
At the beginning, there are six boxes showing different services. That's too many choices. I don't know which one to pick. I don't know if I need all of them or just one. The boxes made me feel stressed.

**The Six Problem Boxes:**
Later, there are six more boxes about problems they solve. Again, too many. My brain got tired trying to understand all of them.

**The "Our Signature Approach" Section:**
This section has three main parts (Discover, Deliver, Release), and each part has multiple bullet points with long sentences. I tried to read all of it, but I couldn't remember what I read at the beginning by the time I finished.

**The Long Paragraphs Everywhere:**
Almost every section has a paragraph with three, four, or five sentences. The sentences are long and have big words. After reading two or three sections like this, my brain felt full. I couldn't process any more.

**Case Studies with Statistics:**
There are case studies showing numbers like "5,400+ Current Users" and "3,200+ Unique Projects Created" and "30+ Countries." Each case study has multiple numbers. I couldn't keep track of all of them.

**Award Badges:**
At the bottom, there are seven different award pictures all in a row. I looked at them but couldn't read what they all said. Too many at once.

### 2. Instructions That Were Too Complex

**"Complete the form below to tell us about your project":**
The contact page says to fill out a form. But what information do they need? What should I write? How much detail? The instruction doesn't tell me. This made me worried about making mistakes.

**The "Research & Define" Bullet Point:**
It says: "Align on scope, priorities, including outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept."

This is seven different things I'm supposed to align on. Which order do I do them in? Are they all equally important? This is too much to remember.

**The "Development" Bullet Point:**
"Build iteratively with bi-weekly sprint releases. Sync and demo weekly with client."

This has multiple steps (build, release, sync, demo) and multiple time schedules (bi-weekly, weekly). It's confusing. How many times do I have to do things? When?

**The Homepage First Paragraph:**
"From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."

This sentence is trying to tell me multiple things they do (strategy, execution, build, modernize, reduce, unlock). It's too many actions in one sentence.

### 3. Points Where Memory Load Was High

**Remembering What the Six Services Are:**
After I scrolled past the six service boxes, I couldn't remember all six. I remembered maybe three or four. If I needed to go back and find a specific one, I'd have to scroll back up and look again.

**Trying to Understand the Three-Step Process:**
The "Discover, Deliver, Release" section has three main steps, but each step has multiple sub-steps. By the time I finished reading about "Release," I forgot what "Discover" was about.

**Keeping Track of What Page I'm On:**
When I clicked "Connect with an Expert," a new page loaded. Then I scrolled down a lot on that page. I started to forget how I got there. If I wanted to go back to the home page, I wasn't sure how.

**The Long List of Company Logos:**
There are twelve company logos at the top. I looked at them, but I couldn't remember all twelve. They showed me the company works with big places, but I couldn't list them all.

**All the Buzzwords and Big Words:**
Words like "bespoke," "scalable," "iteratively," "UAT validation," "ROI," "cross-functional," "streamline," "legacy," "deploy," "seamless handoff" - by the end of the website, I'd seen so many unfamiliar words that they all blended together in my mind.

**Case Study Details:**
Each case study has a company name, a project name, and multiple statistics. By the time I looked at the third case study, I'd forgotten what the first one was about.

### 4. Moments of Confusion or Disorientation

**"AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development":**
This is the very first thing I saw (in the page title). I didn't know what it meant. It set the tone that this website might be too complicated for me.

**"Agentic AI":**
This word confused me a lot. I don't think "agentic" is a real word. It made me wonder if the other words were real or if they were making things up.

**"From strategy to execution":**
I don't know what "strategy to execution" means as a process. Strategy is planning, right? Execution is doing? But how does one become the other?

**"Bespoke, redefining experiences":**
This phrase under "Web Application Development" made no sense to me. What is bespoke? How do you redefine an experience?

**"UAT validation":**
These letters appeared under "QA Testing." I don't know what UAT stands for. It might as well be a random code.

**"Seamless handoff":**
Under the "Deploy" section. I understand the individual words "seamless" and "handoff," but together in this context, I'm not sure what it means. Handing off what? To whom?

**When the Contact Page Loaded:**
I clicked "Connect with an Expert" and a new page appeared. The title said "Ready to Build Something Great?" but I was expecting to see contact information immediately. Instead, I saw a message about a form. I had to scroll a lot before finding the actual phone number and email. I felt disoriented because the page wasn't what I expected.

**Multiple "Learn More" Buttons:**
There are many buttons that all say "Learn More." If I click one, which page will open? Will I be able to find my way back? I was confused about whether they all go to different places or the same place.

### 5. What Would Simplify the Experience

**Say What You Do in Simple Words at the Very Top:**

Instead of "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development," say:

"We make websites and apps for businesses."

That's it. Simple. Clear. I would understand right away.

**Use Shorter Sentences:**

Instead of: "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services."

Say: "LaunchPad Lab helps businesses. We use AI. We build custom computer programs."

Three short sentences. Each sentence has one idea.

**Explain Big Words:**

If you must use a big word, explain it:
- "Bespoke means custom-made for you"
- "Deploy means we put your website online"
- "ROI means Return on Investment (the money you get back)"

Or better: just don't use big words. Use simple words instead.

**Fewer Choices:**

Instead of six service boxes, have three. Or even better, have ONE main message like "We build custom software" and then let me explore more if I want.

Six boxes is too many. I get stressed trying to pick one.

**Break Up Long Paragraphs:**

Use bullet points instead of paragraphs. Like this:

We help businesses by:
- Making websites
- Making phone apps
- Using AI to save time
- Giving support after we finish

Bullet points are easier for me to read than long paragraphs.

**Put the Phone Number at the Top of Every Page:**

Don't make me search for it. Put it at the very top in big letters:

**Need Help? Call us: (312) 888-9651**

Then I can call right away if I'm confused.

**Clear Progress Indicators:**

If there's a process with multiple steps (like Discover, Deliver, Release), show me where I am:

Step 1 of 3: We learn about your project
Step 2 of 3: We build your project
Step 3 of 3: We give you the finished project

This helps me understand how many steps there are and where I am.

**One Idea Per Section:**

Each section should explain ONE thing only. Don't put multiple ideas in the same place.

Like:
- Section 1: What we do (we make websites)
- Section 2: Who we help (businesses)
- Section 3: How to contact us (phone and email)

**Use Pictures to Explain:**

Instead of writing "We build digital products," show a picture of a website or phone with an app. Pictures help me understand faster than words.

**No Strange Words:**

Don't use words like "agentic" or "bespoke" or "leverage" or "synergy." These words confuse me. Use normal words that people say in everyday conversation.

**Make Forms Optional:**

The contact page says "Complete the form below." This sounds like I HAVE to fill out a form.

Instead, say: "You can fill out this form OR you can call us OR you can email us."

Give me choices. Let me pick the easiest way.

**Test with Real People Like Me:**

Have someone with cognitive difficulties try to use your website. Watch them. See where they get confused. Then fix those parts.

**Add a "Simple Version" Option:**

At the top of the website, have a button that says "Simple Version." When I click it, I see the same information but with shorter words, shorter sentences, and fewer choices.

**Clear Back Buttons:**

When I click to a new page, show me a clear way to go back. Like a big button that says "Back to Home Page."

**Summary Boxes:**

At the end of each section, have a small box that says:

"In short: We make websites and apps for businesses."

This reminds me what I just read, in case I forgot.

## Final Thoughts

I finished looking at the website. I found the phone number and email. I have a basic idea that this company does computer work for businesses.

But it was hard. Very hard.

My brain feels tired from trying to understand all the big words and long sentences. I feel a little frustrated because I don't feel smart enough to understand a "normal" business website.

The information is all there. The company seems good. They've worked for a long time with big clients. But the way they wrote the website makes it hard for someone like me.

If they used simpler words and shorter sentences, I would understand better. If they had fewer choices, I would feel less stressed. If they put the phone number at the top, I would find it faster.

I hope they can make changes so people like me can use their website more easily. We deserve to understand too.
