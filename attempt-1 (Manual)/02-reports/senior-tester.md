## My Experience Browsing the Site

Oh my goodness, this was quite overwhelming. Let me tell you what happened when I tried to use this website.

When I first opened the page, there was so much text everywhere. The very top said "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development" - I had to read that three times and I'm still not entirely sure what it means. Is this a computer company? Do they sell something?

Then there's a big headline that says "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." I know AI is that artificial intelligence thing everyone talks about on the news, but what are "digital solutions"? Solutions to what? And underneath that, there's even MORE text: "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services." 

I'm already tired just from the first screen.

I see a blue button that says "Connect with an Expert" - okay, that seems friendly. At least I can talk to someone. But wait, should I click it yet? I don't even know what this company does. What if it takes me somewhere I can't get back from? I've heard about websites that trap you.

I scroll down a little bit and there are all these company logos - Harvard, Northwestern, some hospitals. That's good, I suppose. Big names. Makes it seem more legitimate, less like one of those scam websites. But I'm still confused about what this company actually does FOR these places.

Keep scrolling... oh dear, there's a section called "Your Strategic AI Partner" and then more paragraphs of text. "We combine deep expertise in product design and development with cutting-edge AI consulting..." I'm squinting at the screen now. The text is quite small. And what does "cutting-edge" mean? Like scissors? No, that can't be right. It must mean something modern.

Then I see six boxes with different services:
- AI Automation & Agentic AI (what in the world is "agentic"?)
- Web Application Development 
- Mobile Application Development
- Salesforce Development (is this about salespeople?)
- Product Strategy & Design
- Managed Services & Support

Each one has a "Learn More" button. That's SIX different things to click on. Which one should I click? I'm not even sure which one applies to me or what I'm looking for. This is making me anxious. Maybe I should just call them instead.

I keep scrolling because I'm trying to find a phone number or address. There's a section called "Problems We Solve" with even more boxes - Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement... The words are swimming together now. My eyes are getting tired.

Oh! Numbers! "12+ Years in Business" - okay, that I can understand. "730+ Projects" and "240+ Clients" - alright, so they've been around a while and people use them. That's reassuring.

But then there's more... "Our Signature Approach" with something called "Discover, Deliver, Release" - and under each heading there's technical language like "UAT validation," "bi-weekly sprint releases," "iterative." I don't know what any of that means. Is this how computers work? 

I'm getting quite frustrated now. Where's the phone number? I just want to call someone and ask them in plain English what they do.

Finally! I scroll all the way to the bottom and see "Reach Out - Let's Build Something Great." I click on that hoping to find contact information.

A new page loads - thank goodness it didn't open in a new window, I hate when that happens and I lose track of where I am. The page says "Ready to Build Something Great?" and there's... a FORM. Oh no. I have to fill out a form? 

Let me see... it probably asks for my name, email, phone number... wait, I don't see the actual form fields in what I'm reading. But I can see there are testimonials from other clients. That's nice, I suppose. Real people saying good things.

I keep looking and - oh, there it is! Under a section called "Let's Connect":

**Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
**Phone:** (312) 888-9651  
**LinkedIn:** (there's a link)

Finally! A phone number! (312) - that's Chicago, I think. That's good, an American company. I could call them during business hours. The email address looks legitimate too - it's their own domain name, not a free Gmail or something suspicious.

But honestly, by this point, I'm exhausted. I've been clicking around for what feels like twenty minutes and I'm still not 100% certain what this company does. They seem to make... computer programs? Apps? Websites? Something with AI? For businesses?

## What Does This Company Do?

From what I can gather - and please understand I'm not entirely confident about this - LaunchPad Lab is a computer technology company that helps businesses with their computer systems and websites.

I THINK they do these things:

1. **Build websites and phone apps** - They mentioned "web application development" and "mobile application development" several times. So if a business needs a website or an app for phones, they can build it.

2. **Something with AI** - This artificial intelligence stuff is mentioned everywhere on the site. They help companies use AI somehow. Maybe to automate things? I read something about "autonomous digital workforce" which sounds like robots doing work.

3. **Fix or update old computer systems** - I saw something about "modernize legacy systems" which I think means they help if your computers are old and need updating.

4. **Salesforce** - They keep mentioning this word. I don't know if this means they help with sales teams, or if Salesforce is a specific computer program. I'm not sure.

5. **Ongoing help and support** - At least they mentioned they stick around after they build something, which is good. Not a fly-by-night operation.

They've been in business since 2012 (so about 13-14 years now), and they've worked with over 240 companies including universities and hospitals. That makes me feel like they're probably legitimate and not a scam.

But I have to be honest - if you asked me to explain to my daughter exactly what they do, I'd struggle. They seem to do... everything with computers and technology for businesses? But the specific services are very confusing with all the technical language.

## Where and How to Contact Them

This part is clear, thank goodness:

**Phone Number:** (312) 888-9651  
**Email Address:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
**LinkedIn:** They have a business page on LinkedIn (I don't use LinkedIn myself)

There's also a contact form on their website, but you'd have to fill it out and wait for them to get back to you. I'd rather just call during business hours - seems more straightforward and I can ask questions directly.

The phone number starts with 312 which I believe is Chicago area code, so they're based in the United States. That makes me feel better - not some overseas operation.

## My Summary as a 76-Year-Old User

### 1. Confusing Elements

- **Too many service options:** They list 6 different services right on the main page. I don't know which one I need or what the difference is between them. It's overwhelming.

- **"Agentic AI":** What is this word? I've never heard it in my life. Even "AI" itself is confusing enough.

- **Multiple "Learn More" buttons:** Every section has a button to learn more. If I click on all of them, I'll be here all day and probably get lost.

- **Technical process names:** Words like "UAT validation," "bi-weekly sprint releases," "iterative development," "agile product teams" - I don't understand any of this.

- **"ROI":** They keep using these three letters. What do they stand for? Why not just spell it out?

- **The amount of scrolling:** The page just keeps going and going. I wasn't sure when it would end or if I'd missed something important higher up.

- **"Salesforce":** Is this a computer program or about sales teams? They mention it like everyone should know what it is.

### 2. Hard-to-Read Text

- **Small font size:** A lot of the body text is quite small. I had to lean forward and squint multiple times. My reading glasses help, but the text could be bigger.

- **Too much text in paragraphs:** Long, dense paragraphs with big words make my eyes glaze over. After reading two or three sentences, I lose track of what they're saying.

- **Gray text on white background:** Some of the text isn't pure black - it's a lighter gray color which is harder for me to read. More contrast would help.

- **Text over images:** In some sections, they put white text over photos. If the photo is light-colored, the text almost disappears.

- **The font itself:** The font is modern and sleek, I suppose, but some letters look very similar. The lowercase "l" and uppercase "I" are hard to tell apart.

### 3. Scary or Untrustworthy Moments

- **When I first saw all the technical jargon:** My immediate thought was "Is this a real company or is this one of those scam sites that uses big words to confuse people?" I've heard about tech support scams on the news.

- **The contact form:** I was worried that if I filled out the form, I'd start getting spam emails or phone calls. I much prefer having a phone number I can call myself.

- **Not seeing the contact information right away:** I had to scroll all the way to the bottom and then click to another page. For a moment I thought, "What if there's no way to contact them? What if it's not a real company?"

- **When pages loaded:** Every time I clicked something and a new page loaded, I had a moment of panic - "Did I leave the website? How do I get back?"

- **All the technical language:** When companies use a lot of jargon and technical terms, I sometimes wonder if they're hiding something or trying to sound more impressive than they are.

- **Download links:** I saw mentions of "Download Our Guide" - I'm always nervous about downloading things. What if it's a virus?

### 4. Places I Felt Lost

- **The main page after the first screen:** Once I scrolled past the initial headline, I wasn't sure what I was supposed to look at next. There were so many sections and boxes.

- **Trying to understand their services:** Even after reading multiple sections, I still couldn't articulate clearly what they do. Are they programmers? Consultants? Both?

- **The navigation menu:** I'm sure there was a menu at the top of the page, but I didn't really understand how to use it or where different links would take me.

- **When I saw "Case Studies":** I clicked on one thinking it would help me understand their work, but it was full of statistics and business jargon. I gave up halfway through.

- **The difference between their services:** Web development, mobile development, product design, AI automation - they all sound similar to me. What makes them different?

- **Understanding the process:** They have "Discover, Deliver, Release" but what does that mean for me as a potential customer? How long does it take? How much does it cost?

- **"Related Content" section:** At the bottom there were links to blog posts and downloads. I wasn't sure if I needed to read those too or if they were optional.

### 5. What Would Have Helped Me

- **A simple, one-sentence explanation right at the top:** Something like "We build custom software and websites for businesses" in BIG, clear letters. That's it. Then I'd understand immediately.

- **Bigger text throughout:** I should be able to read everything comfortably without leaning forward or squinting. Size 16 or 18 font would be much better than what they have.

- **Phone number at the top of the page:** Put the contact information where I can see it immediately. Don't make me hunt for it.

- **Plain English:** Instead of "harness the power of AI through tailored consulting," just say "We help your business use AI technology." 

- **Fewer choices:** Instead of 6 service boxes, maybe have 2-3 main categories with simple names. Too many options paralyze me.

- **A short video explanation:** If someone could explain what the company does in a 2-minute video with clear speech and captions, that would be wonderful. I learn better from hearing and seeing than reading lots of text.

- **A glossary or help button:** When they use technical terms like "Agentic AI" or "Salesforce" or "ROI," there could be a small question mark icon I could click to see a simple definition.

- **Step-by-step guidance:** Maybe a message that says "New to our website? Start here" with a clear path to follow.

- **Reassurance about forms and downloads:** Text that says "We will never share your information" or "This PDF is safe to download" would make me feel more confident.

- **Better contrast:** Make all the text dark black on white background. No gray text, no text over images.

- **A simple FAQ section early on:** Answer basic questions like "What do you do?", "How much does it cost?", "How long does a project take?", "Where are you located?" right up front.

- **Pictures or diagrams:** Show me what they do with simple pictures or diagrams instead of just walls of text.

- **Bigger, clearer buttons:** The "Connect with an Expert" button was good, but some of the other buttons were small and I wasn't sure if they were clickable.

## Final Thoughts

Look, I'm sure this company does excellent work - they've been around for over a decade and worked with major universities and hospitals. But their website is not designed for someone like me.

I felt overwhelmed, confused, and at times even a bit suspicious because I couldn't understand what they were trying to tell me. If I were actually looking to hire a technology company, I probably would have given up and called a competitor whose website was simpler.

I did eventually find the phone number, which I appreciate. If I had a real need, I'd call them and ask to speak to someone who could explain things in plain English. But it would have been so much easier if the website itself had been clear from the start.

My advice to them: Remember that not everyone who visits your website is a technology expert. Some of us just need simple, clear information. Use bigger text, simpler words, and less of everything. Quality over quantity.

I'd give the website 4 out of 10 for someone my age and tech level. They have good contact information and seem legitimate, but getting to that point was exhausting.
