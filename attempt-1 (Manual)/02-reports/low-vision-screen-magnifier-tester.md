# Low Vision Screen Magnifier Tester Report

## Persona

**Name:** Thomas Rodriguez, 58 years old  
**Condition:** Macular degeneration with significantly reduced central vision  
**Assistive Technology:** ZoomText screen magnifier set to 300% zoom  
**Browser:** Chrome with zoom set to 300%

I've had progressive vision loss for the past 8 years. I can still see, but I need to magnify everything significantly. I use a combination of my browser's zoom (usually at 300%) and sometimes ZoomText software when I need even more magnification. At this zoom level, I can only see a small window of content at a time - maybe a quarter of what people with normal vision see. I'm constantly panning left, right, up, and down to piece together what's on the page.

## Browsing Experience

### Landing on the Homepage

Okay, I've zoomed my browser to 300% and loaded launchpadlab.com. Right away, I can see I'm going to have to do a lot of panning around.

When the page first loads, I see a large headline that says "AI Innovation." I pan right... "Digital Solutions." Pan right again... "Results that Matter." 

So that whole headline is broken across multiple screen views for me. I had to pan horizontally three times just to read the main message. This is already exhausting.

Below that, there's some body text. Let me read it... I can see "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness..." but the sentence continues off the right edge of my screen. I pan right to continue reading. The text wraps oddly at this zoom level - I'm seeing maybe 8-10 words per line before I have to pan right again or it wraps to the next line.

There's a blue button that says "Connect with an Expert." Good, at least that button is big enough that I can see the whole thing at once. That's helpful.

### The Logo Section - Total Chaos

Now I'm scrolling down and... oh boy. There's a section with company logos. At 300% zoom, these are arranged in what looks like a horizontal row, but I can only see one or two logos at a time. 

I see "Kawasaki Engines" on the left side of my screen. I pan right... there's another logo. Pan right again... another logo. How many are there? I've lost count. I pan back to the left to see where this section started, then try to pan systematically to the right to see all the logos.

I counted 12 logos total, but they're laid out in a grid that completely breaks at this zoom level. Some logos are partially cut off at the edges of my viewport. I had to pan left and right about 8 times just to see all the company names. Very disorienting.

The problem is that these logos are arranged in multiple rows when zoomed out normally, but at my zoom level, they're stretching across the screen horizontally, and I can't tell where one row ends and another begins. The layout is just... broken.

### Service Boxes - Worse Than I Expected

I keep scrolling down, and now I see a section with services. There's a heading "AI Automation & Agentic AI" that I can see, and below it some descriptive text, and a "Learn More" button.

But here's the problem: at 300% zoom, I can see ONE service box takes up my entire viewport height-wise. And when I pan right, I see that the boxes are arranged in columns, so I also have to pan horizontally to see the next box.

Let me try to count how many services they have...

1. AI Automation (I can see this one fully)
2. Pan right... Web Application Development
3. Pan right... Mobile Application Development  
4. Pan right... oh, it wrapped to a new row. I pan back left and scroll down...
5. Salesforce Development
6. Pan right... Product Strategy & Design
7. Pan right... Managed Services & Support

So there are 6 services total, arranged in what I think is a 3-column grid. But at my zoom level, I have to do this complicated dance of panning right, right, right, then scrolling down, panning left, left, left, then panning right again. It's like a video game navigation puzzle, except I'm just trying to read a website.

Each "Learn More" button is a decent size, which is good. But because of the grid layout, I had to pan and scroll about 12 times just to see all six services.

### Horizontal Scrolling Hell

Around this point, I notice something frustrating: the page is wider than my viewport even when I'm zoomed to 300%. Normally, responsive websites reflow the content to fit the width when you zoom in. But this site keeps the multi-column layout, which means I'm constantly scrolling horizontally.

I have to use my keyboard arrow keys or drag my scrollbar left and right, constantly, just to read content. This is not how websites are supposed to work when zoomed.

### Problems We Solve Section - More Grid Layout Issues

I scroll down to a section called "Problems We Solve." Again, there are boxes arranged in a grid:
- Operational Efficiency
- Modern Technology  
- Customer Engagement
- Scalable Solutions
- Expansive Resources
- Speed to Market

Same problem as before. I can see one box at a time, and I have to pan right and down and right and down to see all six. Each box has an icon, a heading, a description, and an image. 

But at 300% zoom, sometimes the image is cut off at the bottom of my viewport, and I don't realize there's more content below until I scroll down and suddenly see part of an image appearing. It's jarring. I lose context about which box I'm looking at.

The images in these boxes are quite large, which means they take up a lot of my zoomed viewport. I have to scroll past each image to get to the next section.

### Statistics - Actually Readable!

There's a section with big numbers:
- 12+ Years in Business
- 730+ Projects  
- 240+ Clients

This section actually works well at 300% zoom! The numbers are large and bold. The descriptive text below each number is readable. I had to pan right to see all three statistics (they're arranged horizontally), but at least the content within each statistic box is clear and doesn't break.

This is how content should be presented for screen magnifier users.

### Process Section - Text Overlapping Issues

There's a section about their process: Discover, Deliver, Release.

Under each phase, there are sub-items with longer descriptions. At 300% zoom, some of these descriptions are getting cut off in weird ways. I see text like:

"Align on scope, priorities, including outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept."

This sentence wraps across three or four lines in my viewport. But because of the way the layout is designed, sometimes part of the text overlaps with a background image or the text from the next section starts appearing before I've finished reading the current section.

I had to carefully scroll down line by line to make sure I wasn't missing any text. Very tedious.

### Case Studies - Image Heavy

Scrolling further, there's a "Our Latest Case Studies" section. Each case study has:
- A company logo
- A title
- Statistics
- A screenshot image
- A link to learn more

At 300% zoom, each case study takes up multiple viewport heights. The screenshots are massive on my screen - I can only see maybe a quarter of a screenshot at a time. I have to pan around within each image to see the full thing.

This makes it hard to appreciate what the screenshots are showing. Are they showing computer interfaces? Dashboards? I can't tell because I'm only seeing zoomed-in fragments.

I counted three case studies (Prosci, CDK Global, and Millennium Trust Company), but it took me several minutes of scrolling and panning to get through all of them.

### Awards Section

There are several award badge images displayed. At 300% zoom, I can see one badge at a time. I pan right... another badge. Pan right... another badge.

These badges have small text on them that's hard to read even when zoomed. I can make out something about "Clutch" and "2025" but the details are blurry or too small.

### Finding Contact Information - The Hunt Begins

I've scrolled all the way to the bottom of the page, and I see "Reach Out" and "Let's Build Something Great. Get in touch with one of our experts today!"

But I don't see a phone number or email address here. Let me click on something...

I see there was a "Connect with an Expert" button at the top that I noted earlier. Let me scroll all the way back up (this takes forever with all the content in between) and click that.

### Contact Page - Finally!

New page loaded. "Ready to Build Something Great?"

I'm scrolling down looking for contact info. I see some testimonials... long quotes from clients. These are hard to read at 300% zoom because they're paragraph-length quotes. I'm scrolling, scrolling...

Finally! "Let's Connect"

And I can see:
- Email: contact@launchpadlab.com
- Call: (312) 888-9651
- Connect with Us on Linkedin

The email and phone number are displayed clearly. The text is large enough that I can read them without too much strain. Thank goodness.

But wow, I had to scroll through a LOT of content to find this information.

### Overall Navigation Experience

Navigating this website at 300% zoom was exhausting. I feel like I've been on a marathon scrolling journey. 

The main issues:
1. **Horizontal scrolling everywhere** - The multi-column grid layouts don't reflow to single column at high zoom, so I'm constantly panning left and right
2. **Content cut off at viewport edges** - Images, text, and buttons are frequently cut off, and I don't know what I'm missing until I pan around
3. **No sense of page structure** - At 300% zoom, I can't see the overall layout or hierarchy. Everything feels like disconnected fragments
4. **Excessive panning required** - I estimate I panned left/right at least 50 times and scrolled down at least 100 times just to view the homepage
5. **Grid layouts that break** - Every section with multiple columns (services, problems, case studies, logos) becomes a navigation nightmare

## How to Contact Them

**Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
**Phone:** (312) 888-9651  
**LinkedIn:** They have a company LinkedIn page (there's a link on the contact page)

This information is located on their Contact page: https://launchpadlab.com/contact/

To find it, I had to:
1. Click the "Connect with an Expert" button from the homepage
2. Scroll through the entire contact page (past a form description and many testimonials)
3. Finally reach the "Let's Connect" section at the bottom

The contact details themselves are displayed clearly and are readable at 300% zoom, which is good. But getting to them required a lot of scrolling and searching.

## Summary

### 1. Layout Issues at High Zoom

**Multi-Column Grids Don't Reflow:**
The biggest problem with this website at 300% zoom is that all the multi-column layouts remain multi-column. They don't automatically reflow to a single column like responsive websites should.

Specifically:
- **Company logos section** - 12 logos in a grid that stretches horizontally. I had to pan left and right repeatedly to see all of them. At high zoom, this should be a single vertical column.

- **6 service boxes** - Arranged in a 3-column grid. At 300% zoom, I can only see one box at a time and have to do complex panning (right, right, right, down, left, left, left) to see all services. Should be stacked vertically.

- **6 problem boxes** - Same issue. 3-column grid that forces horizontal panning. Should reflow to single column.

- **Case studies** - Arranged side-by-side. At my zoom level, I see partial content from multiple case studies simultaneously, which is confusing. Should stack vertically.

- **Award badges** - Horizontal row that requires panning. Should stack or wrap better.

- **Statistics (12+, 730+, 240+)** - Arranged horizontally. I had to pan right to see all three. Single column would be better.

**The website assumes users can see the full width of the page. At 300% zoom, this assumption breaks completely.**

### 2. Elements Cut Off or Overlapping

**Partial Content Visible:**
- **Service box buttons** - Sometimes the "Learn More" button would be cut off at the bottom of my viewport, and I didn't know it was there until I scrolled down further.

- **Images cut off** - Large decorative images and screenshots were frequently cut off at viewport boundaries. I'd see the top half of an image, scroll down, and suddenly see the bottom half. Disorienting.

- **Text wrapping oddly** - Long sentences would wrap in unexpected places because of the zoom level. Sometimes a word would be split across my viewport edge, and I'd lose reading flow.

- **Headings separated from content** - Often, a section heading would be at the bottom of my viewport, and I'd have to scroll down to see the content that belongs to that heading. The visual connection between heading and content was lost.

**Overlapping Issues:**
- In some sections with background images or decorative elements, the text would overlap with those elements at 300% zoom. While the text was still readable (mostly), it reduced contrast and made reading harder.

- The process section (Discover, Deliver, Release) had some overlapping issues where bullet points seemed to run into each other visually when zoomed.

### 3. Excessive Scrolling or Panning

I kept count during my browsing session:

**Horizontal Panning:** Approximately 50-60 times
- Company logos section: 8 pans
- Services section: 12 pans (back and forth across the grid)
- Problems section: 12 pans  
- Case studies: 10 pans
- Awards section: 6 pans
- Various other sections: 12+ pans

**Vertical Scrolling:** Approximately 100+ scrolls down (and about 20 scrolls back up when I got lost or needed to return to something)

**Why This Is Exhausting:**
Normal websites at 300% zoom should primarily require vertical scrolling only. Horizontal panning should be minimal or non-existent. 

This website required constant two-dimensional navigation (up/down AND left/right), which is:
- Cognitively demanding (I have to remember where I am in 2D space)
- Physically tiring (more mouse/trackpad movements or keyboard arrow key presses)
- Time-consuming (took me about 15 minutes to thoroughly review the homepage)
- Disorienting (I frequently lost track of which section I was in)

### 4. Contrast or Readability Problems

**Light Gray Text:**
Many sections use light gray text for body copy (probably #666 or #777 color code). At 300% zoom, this light gray is harder to read than pure black text would be. My vision is already compromised, and low-contrast text makes it worse.

Specific examples:
- Service descriptions under each service heading (like "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce") - this light gray text was hard to read
- Long paragraph sections explaining their expertise - light gray body text
- Testimonial quotes - some were in lighter gray

**Small Text That Doesn't Scale Well:**
- Award badge text - even at 300% zoom, the text on the award images was too small to read clearly
- Some image captions or secondary text - appeared blurry when magnified

**Text Over Images:**
- In a few places, text appeared over background images or photos. Even though there might be a dark overlay to improve contrast, at high zoom levels, this still reduced readability compared to plain text on a solid background.

**What Worked Well:**
- The main headlines (like "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter.") were in large, bold, dark text - easy to read
- The statistics numbers (12+, 730+, 240+) were large and high contrast - excellent
- The "Connect with an Expert" button had good contrast and large text - very readable
- Contact information (email and phone) on the contact page was clear and dark - easy to read

### 5. What Would Make Navigation Easier When Zoomed

**CRITICAL FIXES:**

✅ **Reflow to Single Column at High Zoom**
- When the browser is zoomed to 200%+, ALL multi-column layouts should automatically collapse to a single column
- Service boxes should stack vertically (1 column, not 3)
- Problem boxes should stack vertically
- Company logos should stack vertically
- Case studies should stack vertically
- This would eliminate 90% of the horizontal panning I had to do

✅ **Responsive Design Testing**
- Test the website at 200%, 300%, and 400% zoom levels
- Ensure no horizontal scrolling is required
- Make sure all content reflows and remains readable

✅ **Use Darker Text Colors**
- Change all body text from light gray to dark gray (#333) or pure black (#000)
- Never use #999 or lighter for any text
- High contrast is essential for low vision users

✅ **Avoid Text Over Images**
- Keep all important text on solid, high-contrast backgrounds
- If you must overlay text on images, ensure VERY high contrast (white text on very dark overlay, or black text on very light overlay)

✅ **Bigger Touch Targets with More Spacing**
- Buttons and links should be large enough to click easily (at least 44px tall)
- Add more vertical space between sections so content doesn't feel cramped when zoomed

✅ **Limit Decorative Images**
- Large decorative images take up a lot of viewport space when zoomed
- Either make them smaller or allow them to be hidden at high zoom levels
- Focus on content, not decoration

✅ **Simplify Grid Layouts**
- Instead of 3-column grids, consider 2-column or single-column layouts by default
- Even at normal zoom levels, simpler layouts are easier to scan

✅ **Add Skip Links or Quick Navigation**
- A "Skip to Contact Information" link at the top would save magnifier users tons of scrolling
- Section navigation or a table of contents would help users jump directly to what they need

✅ **Sticky Headers Should Be Optional or Small**
- Fixed/sticky headers that stay at the top while scrolling take up valuable viewport space
- At 300% zoom, a sticky header might cover 30-40% of the visible area
- Either make sticky headers collapsible or don't use them

✅ **Mobile-First Design Approach**
- Design as if every user is on a narrow mobile screen
- This naturally creates single-column layouts that work well when zoomed
- Then enhance for larger screens, rather than the reverse

✅ **Clear Visual Hierarchy Without Relying on Layout**
- Use heading sizes, font weights, and colors to show hierarchy
- Don't rely on spatial positioning (left vs. right, top vs. bottom) because magnifier users can't see the overall layout

✅ **Test with Real Magnification Tools**
- Use ZoomText, Windows Magnifier, or browser zoom at 300%+
- Navigate the site as if you can only see a small window at a time
- Fix any issues where content is cut off, overlapping, or requires horizontal scrolling

## Final Thoughts

As a screen magnifier user at 300% zoom, this website was functional but extremely frustrating to navigate. I was able to complete my goals (figure out what the company does and find contact information), but it took 3-4 times longer than it should have.

The root cause: **the website doesn't properly reflow content at high zoom levels**. Multi-column layouts remain multi-column, forcing constant horizontal panning. This is the opposite of how responsive web design should work.

If I were a potential client with low vision, I might give up on this website and look for a competitor with a more accessible site. Or I'd just call the phone number directly (once I finally found it) rather than try to navigate through all the service information.

**My rating: 3/10 for screen magnifier accessibility**

The content is there, the buttons are clickable, and the text is readable (barely). But the navigation experience at high zoom is so painful that it significantly discourages use.

**One simple fix would dramatically improve this:** Make all grid layouts collapse to single column at 200%+ zoom. That alone would probably bring this to a 7/10 or 8/10.

Please, web designers: test your sites at high zoom levels. We low vision users are out here trying to use your websites, and we need you to make them work for us.
