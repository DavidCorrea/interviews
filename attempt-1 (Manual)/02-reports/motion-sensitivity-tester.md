# Motion Sensitivity Tester Report

## Persona

**Name:** Rebecca Martinez, 42 years old  
**Location:** Portland, Oregon  
**Background:** Former graphic designer who developed vestibular disorder after a concussion three years ago

I used to love beautiful, dynamic websites with all their fancy effects. But after my concussion in 2023, everything changed. Now, when I see animations, moving backgrounds, or things sliding around on screen, I get instant vertigo. My symptoms include dizziness, nausea, headaches, and a general feeling of being off-balance that can last for hours after exposure.

I've had to significantly change how I use computers. I keep my screen brightness low, take frequent breaks, and I've learned to identify "problem websites" quickly - usually within the first few seconds of a page loading. If I start feeling dizzy, I close the tab immediately and rest. It's frustrating because I work from home doing administrative work, so I have to use the internet daily.

My neurologist explained that my vestibular system (the part of the inner ear that controls balance) got damaged, and now it conflicts with what my eyes see when there's screen motion. It's like motion sickness, but triggered by visual movement instead of actual movement.

## Browsing Experience

### Initial Page Load

Okay, deep breath. Let me try loading launchpadlab.com...

*Page loads*

Oh no. Oh no no no. The page just loaded and I can already feel it starting. There's this... the hero section at the top - "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." - and the text is doing something. It looks like it faded in or maybe slid in from somewhere? My stomach just flipped.

I'm gripping my desk to steady myself. The room feels like it's tilting slightly to the left. This is not good.

### Company Logo Section

I'm trying to focus on breathing and reading the actual content. I see they work with big companies - Harvard, Northwestern, some hospitals. 

Wait, are those logos moving? Or am I moving? I can't tell anymore. When I moved my mouse over one of the logos, I think it did a little bounce or zoom thing. My head just got this sharp stabbing pain behind my left eye.

I need to look away from the screen for a moment.

*Looking at the wall for 30 seconds*

Okay. Continuing.

### Scrolling Down - The Nightmare Begins

I'm scrolling down slowly, very slowly, using my mouse wheel in tiny increments because I've learned that helps sometimes.

OH GOD. The service boxes - AI Automation, Web Development, Mobile Apps, etc. - they're all FADING IN as I scroll past them. Each one appears with this swoosh or fade effect. My vision just did this weird swimmy thing where everything went blurry for a second.

I'm seriously nauseous now. That feeling in your throat when you're about to throw up? I have that.

The boxes also have these hover effects - when my cursor accidentally went over one, the whole box lifted up or the button changed color, or something moved. I'm not even sure what exactly happened because I had to look away immediately.

### Service Cards Section

There are six service cards arranged in a grid, and as I scroll, each one appears. Not all at once - they fade in one after another, or maybe in a staggered pattern? It's like watching dominoes fall, except each domino makes me more dizzy.

I had to close my eyes for that part. I'm now scrolling blind, counting to three between each scroll, then opening my eyes briefly to see if I've passed that section.

### Problems We Solve Section

More boxes. More icons. More things appearing as I scroll.

I think the images or icons in these boxes are animated too - maybe they grow or rotate when they come into view? I can't look at them directly. I'm only reading the text in my peripheral vision now, which is a trick I learned to avoid triggering symptoms.

The section has something about "Operational Efficiency," "Modern Technology," "Customer Engagement" - but honestly, I'm skimming as fast as I can to get through this page.

### Statistics Section

The numbers - "12+ Years in Business," "730+ Projects," "240+ Clients" - I THINK these might be counting up? Like, starting from 0 and rapidly counting to the final number? Or am I imagining that? 

My heart is racing now, which is what happens when my vestibular system freaks out. My body thinks I'm in danger because my balance system is confused.

I'm sweating. This is really bad.

### Case Studies Section

There are these big screenshots of their work. At first I thought they were just static images, but when I scrolled past them, they did... something. Maybe they enlarged slightly? Or slid into place?

There are also company logos that definitely did something when they appeared. A little bounce? A rotation? Whatever it was, my stomach lurched.

I'm trying to scroll quickly past this section but that makes it worse because more things trigger at once.

### Awards/Badges Section

A row of award badges. These might be in a carousel? Or they might auto-rotate? I can't tell if they're actually moving or if my vision is just swimming so badly at this point that everything appears to be moving.

I need to stop. I'm closing the page.

*Closes browser tab and sits with head in hands for 5 minutes*

### Attempt #2 - Finding Contact Information

Okay, I've rested. I took some deep breaths. I got a glass of water. I'm going to try again, but this time I'm going to disable JavaScript in my browser first - that sometimes helps stop animations.

*Reopens page with JavaScript disabled*

Much better. No fading. No sliding. Just... static content. I can actually read this now without wanting to vomit.

Looking for contact information... I see there's a "Connect with an Expert" button at the top. Let me click that.

The contact page loaded. Still no animations with JavaScript off - thank goodness.

Scrolling down... there's a form at the top, some testimonials, and finally, at the bottom, actual contact details:

**Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
**Phone:** (312) 888-9651

There's also a LinkedIn link, and the page mentions they're in Chicago (which matches the 312 area code).

Based on the information provided, their address is:
**2045 W Grand Ave Ste B, Chicago IL 60612**

And they're also on:
- Facebook

## Summary

### 1. Animations That Caused Discomfort

**Hero Section Entrance Animation:**
The main headline area ("AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter.") appears to have a fade-in or slide-in animation when the page first loads. This was the first thing that triggered my symptoms - instant dizziness.

**Scroll-Triggered Fade-Ins:**
Almost every section of the page has elements that fade in or slide in as you scroll past them:
- The six service cards (AI Automation, Web Development, etc.) - each one fades/slides in
- The "Problems We Solve" boxes - all six fade in as you scroll
- Case study sections - company logos and screenshots animate in
- Award badges - appear with animation

**Hover Effects on Boxes:**
The service cards and problem cards have hover animations - when you move your mouse over them, they lift up, change color, or have some kind of transformation. This is particularly problematic because you can't avoid hovering over things when trying to read or click.

**Button Hover States:**
All the "Learn More" buttons and other call-to-action buttons appear to have animated hover states - color transitions, underlines appearing, shadows changing. These micro-animations happen constantly as you navigate.

**Number Counting Animation:**
The statistics section (12+ Years, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients) might have a counting-up animation where the numbers start at 0 and rapidly count to the final value. This type of rapid motion is especially triggering.

**Logo Bounce/Zoom Effects:**
Company logos in the "Trusted by" section might have subtle bounce or zoom animations on hover or on scroll.

### 2. Auto-Playing or Looping Motion

**Possible Carousel:**
The award badges section might be set up as an auto-rotating carousel that cycles through different badges automatically. If so, this would be constantly triggering motion even when I'm not interacting with the page.

**Company Logo Slider:**
The section showing 12 company logos might be a horizontally scrolling carousel that auto-plays or loops, showing different clients continuously.

**I couldn't confirm for certain** because I had to close the page so quickly, but modern marketing websites often have:
- Auto-playing background videos (didn't see one, but they're common)
- Animated SVG graphics that loop continuously
- Typing effects that repeat
- Parallax backgrounds that shift as you scroll

The fact that I felt symptoms immediately and they got worse as I scrolled suggests there are multiple sources of motion happening simultaneously.

### 3. Scroll-Triggered Effects

**Fade-In On Scroll:**
Nearly every section uses fade-in animations triggered when that section enters the viewport. This is probably the biggest problem - as you scroll down, content constantly fades in, creating continuous motion.

**Slide-In On Scroll:**
Some elements (particularly the service boxes) might slide in from the left or right as you scroll past them.

**Scale/Zoom On Scroll:**
Images and cards might have a slight zoom or scale effect when they enter view.

**Staggered Animation Timing:**
The service cards and problem boxes don't all animate at once - they're staggered, so each one animates in sequence (left to right, or top to bottom). This creates a wave or domino effect that's particularly nauseating because the motion is continuous across the screen.

**Parallax Scrolling:**
While I didn't notice obvious parallax effects (where background moves slower than foreground), the scroll behavior felt "smooth" or "eased" rather than direct - this type of scroll interpolation can trigger symptoms even without traditional parallax.

### 4. Unexpected Movement or Layout Shifts

**Content Loading/Appearing:**
Images and logos loading after the page initially rendered caused the content to shift down. Each time an image loaded, everything below it jumped. This unexpected movement is disorienting.

**Sticky Header (Possibly):**
I think there might be a navigation bar that becomes "sticky" - appearing or changing as you scroll down. This sudden appearance of a fixed element at the top creates unexpected motion.

**Hover State Changes:**
The lift/elevation effect on cards when hovering is unexpected because you don't always realize when your cursor has entered a card area. Suddenly the card moves, which triggers symptoms.

**Dynamic Content Loading:**
If any sections load content dynamically (like case studies or blog posts loading in), this would cause layout shifts as new content appears.

**Modal/Popup Animations:**
While I didn't encounter any, if clicking buttons opens modals with animations (sliding in from side, zooming in from center, fading in with backdrop), these would all be triggers.

### 5. Whether I Would Continue Using the Site

**Honestly? No.**

If I hadn't been doing this test deliberately, I would have closed the page within 10 seconds and never returned. The combination of initial load animation, plus continuous scroll-triggered effects, plus hover animations made this site unusable for me.

Here's what would realistically happen:

1. I'd visit the site
2. Within 5-10 seconds, I'd feel dizzy
3. I'd close the tab immediately
4. The dizziness would persist for 30-60 minutes
5. I'd possibly get a headache that lasts the rest of the day
6. I'd add this to my mental list of "websites to avoid"

If I genuinely needed to contact this company for business reasons, I would:
- Call the phone number directly (if I could find it elsewhere)
- Ask someone else to navigate the site for me
- Try with JavaScript completely disabled (like I did)
- Look for their LinkedIn or other social media with less animation

**The irony:** This is a company that builds digital products. They should understand that their own website is excluding potential clients with motion sensitivity. I can't be the only person who's had this experience.

### 6. What Would Make It More Comfortable

**Immediate Fixes:**

✅ **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:**
This is a browser/OS setting that users can enable to indicate they want reduced motion. The website should check for this setting and disable ALL animations when it's turned on. This is the single most important fix.

In CSS, it looks like this:
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

✅ **Add a "Reduce Motion" Toggle:**
Put a button in the header (visible immediately, before any animations start) that says "Reduce Motion" or "Stop Animations." When clicked, it should:
- Disable all scroll-triggered animations
- Disable all hover effects
- Stop any auto-playing carousels
- Remove all transitions
- Save the preference so it persists across pages

✅ **Remove Auto-Play:**
Nothing should move or animate without user interaction. No auto-rotating carousels. No background videos. No looping animations. If there IS a carousel, add pause/play controls and make it paused by default.

✅ **Eliminate Scroll-Triggered Animations:**
Just show content immediately. Don't fade it in, don't slide it in. Content can be beautiful and engaging without motion. The fade-in effect might look "modern" but it excludes people like me.

✅ **Simplify Hover Effects:**
If you must have hover effects on buttons, keep them simple:
- Change text color (instant, no transition)
- Add/remove an underline (instant, no transition)
- No lifting, no shadows, no scaling, no color transitions

✅ **Remove Smooth Scrolling:**
Let scrolling be direct and immediate. The smooth/eased scrolling that many modern sites use (where scrolling has momentum or easing) can trigger vestibular symptoms.

✅ **Disable Number Counting Animations:**
Just show the numbers immediately: "730+ Projects" should appear as text, not count from 0 to 730.

**Longer-Term Improvements:**

✅ **Test with Motion Disabled:**
Before launching any page, view it with ALL animations turned off. Does it still look good? Does it still function? Can users still accomplish their goals? If yes, then you don't need the animations.

✅ **Use Static Images Instead of Animated SVGs:**
If logos or icons are animated SVGs, use static PNG or SVG files instead.

✅ **Lazy Load Images Without Layout Shift:**
If images load after page load, reserve space for them so nothing jumps when they appear. Use width and height attributes on `<img>` tags.

✅ **Make Motion Opt-In, Not Opt-Out:**
Instead of having animations by default with an option to disable them, consider having a simpler site by default with an option to "Enable Enhanced Animations" for users who want them.

✅ **Provide Text Alternatives:**
If you have video content with motion, provide a text transcript or summary.

✅ **Test with Real Users:**
Invite people with vestibular disorders, seizure disorders, or motion sensitivity to test your site. We'll tell you immediately what's triggering symptoms.

**A Personal Note:**

I know animations look cool. I used to make them! But please understand: for people like me, animations aren't just annoying - they're physically painful and can trigger symptoms that last hours or days.

When you add a fade-in animation that you think looks smooth and modern, you might be excluding 35% of the population who experience dizziness, nausea, or discomfort from it. (Studies suggest vestibular disorders affect 20-35% of adults.)

The web is supposed to be for everyone. A beautiful, functional website doesn't need motion to be effective. Some of the best, most successful websites have minimal or no animation.

Please, LaunchPad Lab and other web developers: make the web accessible to those of us who can't handle motion. It's not hard, and it makes a world of difference.

**Final Rating: 2/10 for motion sensitivity**

The site is functionally navigable with JavaScript disabled, which is the only reason it's not 0/10. But with JavaScript enabled (the default experience), it's completely unusable for anyone with vestibular disorders or motion sensitivity.
