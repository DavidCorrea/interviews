## My Experience Browsing the Site

*Opening the homepage...*

Okay, page loaded. First thing I hear: "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development | LaunchPad Lab"

Good, I know the page title. Now let me check if there's a skip link...

*Pressing Tab*

"Skip to content, link" - excellent! They have a skip navigation link. I'll activate that.

*Pressing Enter on skip link*

Now let me get my bearings by pulling up the heading structure. I press H to navigate by headings.

*Pressing H key repeatedly to navigate through headings*

First heading: "Heading level 1, AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."

Okay, that's the main heading. Pressing H again...

"Heading level 2, Your Strategic AI Partner"

Wait, that jumped from H1 to H2. Let me keep going...

"Heading level 2, AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise"

Hmm, two H2s in a row under the same section? Let me continue...

"Heading level 2, Driving ROI with AI"
"Heading level 2, Make AI Your Competitive Advantage"

Then I hear:

"Heading level 3, AI Automation & Agentic AI"
"Heading level 3, Web Application Development"
"Heading level 3, Mobile Application Development"
"Heading level 3, Salesforce Development"
"Heading level 3, Product Strategy & Design"
"Heading level 3, Managed Services & Support"

Okay, so those are their services. That makes sense - those H3s are grouped under a section. But wait, I didn't hear an H2 introducing those services. The heading structure jumped from "Make AI Your Competitive Advantage" (H2) directly to service names (H3). That's confusing - I don't know what category these H3s belong to.

Let me continue with headings...

"Heading level 2, Problems We Solve"
"Heading level 2, Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast"

Again, two H2s that seem to be for the same section.

Then:
"Heading level 3, Operational Efficiency"
"Heading level 3, Modern Technology"
"Heading level 3, Customer Engagement"
"Heading level 3, Scalable Solutions"
"Heading level 3, Expansive Resources"
"Heading level 3, Speed to Market"

More H3s under that section.

Then I hear:
"Heading level 2, Years in Business"
"Heading level 2, Projects"
"Heading level 2, Clients"

Wait, those sound like statistics, not section headings. Why are individual stats marked as H2s? That seems wrong.

Continuing:
"Heading level 2, Our Signature Approach"
"Heading level 2, Accelerate Digital Product Speed to Market"

Two H2s again for what seems like one section.

"Heading level 3, Discover"
"Heading level 4, Research & Define"
"Heading level 3, Deliver"
"Heading level 4, Development"
"Heading level 4, QA Testing"
"Heading level 3, Release"
"Heading level 4, Deploy"
"Heading level 4, Ongoing Support"

Okay, that structure makes more sense - H3s for main phases, H4s for sub-steps. But wait, I'm jumping from H2 to H3 to H4. Where are the other heading levels being used properly?

Then:
"Heading level 2, Put AI to Work"
"Heading level 2, Transform how your business operates with custom AI solutions"

More duplicate H2s.

"Heading level 2, Our Latest Case Studies"
"Heading level 2, We Help Shape Our Clients' Digital Future"

And again!

"Heading level 3, 360-Customer View in Salesforce"
"Heading level 3, Sales Discovery Portal for Automotive Companies"
"Heading level 3, Spurring Enterprise Innovation"

"Heading level 2, Related Content"
"Heading level 2, You Might Also be Interested In"

"Heading level 3, The Business Value of Building Applications and Portals"
"Heading level 3, Download Our Guide: Building Your Competitive Advantage With Salesforce"
"Heading level 3, How Automated Intelligence Is Reshaping the Way Businesses Scale"

Then finally:
"Heading level 2, Reach Out"
"Heading level 2, Let's Build Something Great."

Okay, so the heading structure is really confusing. Every major section seems to have TWO H2 headings - like a label and then a subtitle. That makes it hard to skim efficiently because I'm hearing duplicate information. And some things that shouldn't be headings (like individual statistics) are marked as H2s.

Now let me try navigating by landmarks. I press D to jump between landmarks.

*Pressing D key*

I'm hoping to hear things like "banner," "navigation," "main," "complementary," "contentinfo"...

But based on the structure, I'm not sure if landmarks are properly implemented. The content seems to just flow without clear landmark regions announced.

Okay, let me try tabbing through interactive elements to find the contact information.

*Pressing Tab repeatedly*

"Link, LaunchPad Lab" - that's probably the logo link
"Connect with an Expert, link" - okay, that sounds like it goes to a contact page

Let me keep tabbing...

"Learn More, link" - which service is this for? The screen reader just says "Learn More" without context.

*Tab again*

"Learn More, link" - another one. Is this for a different service? I can't tell.

*Tab again*

"Learn More, link" - okay, this is getting frustrating. I'm hearing "Learn More" over and over but I don't know what I'm learning more ABOUT. 

Let me count... I'm hearing SIX "Learn More" links in a row. If I pulled up my links list to scan all links on the page, I'd see:
- Learn More
- Learn More
- Learn More
- Learn More
- Learn More
- Learn More

How am I supposed to distinguish between them? I have to tab to each one and rely on context from surrounding text, which is inefficient.

Continuing to tab...

"Learn More, link" - oh great, another "Learn More" link. This one is probably for the AI automation section later on the page.

More tabbing...

"Prosci, link"
"CDK Global, link"
"Millennium Trust Company, link"

Those are probably case study links. At least those have unique names.

Still more links...

"Link, The Business Value of Building Applications and Portals"
"Link, Download Our Guide: Building Your Competitive Advantage With Salesforce"
"Link, How Automated Intelligence Is Reshaping the Way Businesses Scale"

Okay, those blog/content links have descriptive text. Good.

But I still haven't found clear contact information on this page. Let me go to that "Connect with an Expert" link I found earlier.

*Activating "Connect with an Expert" link*

New page loaded. 

*Checking page title*

"Contact Us | LaunchPad Lab" - okay, I'm on the contact page now.

*Pressing H to navigate headings*

"Heading level 1, Ready to Build Something Great?"

Then:
"Heading level 2, Reach Out"
"Heading level 2, Ready to Build Something Great?" - wait, that's the same text as the H1. Why is it repeated as an H2?

"Heading level 2, Testimonials"
"Heading level 2, Hear From Some of Our Recent Clients" - again, two H2s for the same section.

"Heading level 2, Reach out" - that's similar to the earlier "Reach Out" but lowercase 'o'. Are these different sections or the same?

"Heading level 2, Let's Connect"

Then:
"Heading level 3, Email"
"Heading level 3, Call"
"Heading level 3, Connect with Us on Linkedin"

Good! Those are contact methods. Let me tab to those.

*Pressing Tab to navigate to contact info*

Eventually I reach:
"Link, contact@launchpadlab.com" - great, there's an email link!

*Tab again*

"Link, (312) 888-9651" - phone number link!

*Tab again*

"Link, Connect" - this must be the LinkedIn link, but "Connect" by itself isn't very descriptive. It should say "Connect with LaunchPad Lab on LinkedIn" or something like that.

Now, the contact page mentioned "Complete the form below" in the H1, so there should be a form here. Let me tab to find form fields.

*Tabbing through the page*

Hmm, I'm tabbing through testimonial text and other links, but I'm not encountering any form fields. Either the form is further down the page, or maybe it's not keyboard accessible, or maybe the content description was wrong about there being a form.

Let me try navigating by form elements with F key...

No form fields announced. That's strange. The page says "Complete the form below" but I can't find a form.

4. **Salesforce Development** - They do Salesforce customization and development
5. **Product Strategy & Design** - They help with planning and designing digital products

## Where and How to Contact Them

**Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
**Phone:** (312) 888-9651  
**LinkedIn:** There's a "Connect" link that goes to their LinkedIn company page

These contact details are on the Contact page at https://launchpadlab.com/contact/

The page mentions a contact form, but I couldn't locate any form fields when navigating with my screen reader, which is concerning.

## My Summary as a Screen Reader User

### 1. Structural Navigation Issues (Headings, Landmarks)

**Major Issues:**

- **Duplicate H2 headings everywhere:** Almost every section has TWO H2 headings that say similar things. For example: "Problems We Solve" followed immediately by another H2 "Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast." This makes it seem like there are twice as many sections as there actually are. It's confusing and makes heading navigation inefficient.

- **Statistics marked as headings:** The "12+ Years in Business," "730+ Projects," and "240+ Clients" are marked as H2 headings. These are statistics, not section headings. They shouldn't be in the heading hierarchy at all - they should just be regular text or maybe in a list.

- **Inconsistent heading hierarchy:** The page jumps from H1 → H2 → H3 without clear logic. Some H3s appear without a clear parent H2 introducing them. For example, the six service H3s appear right after an H2 about "competitive advantage" that doesn't introduce them.

- **No clear landmark structure:** I couldn't identify clear ARIA landmarks like `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`. Without landmarks, I can't quickly jump to the main content area or navigation menu using landmark navigation (D key).

- **Skip link is good:** The site DOES have a "Skip to content" link, which is great. That's one thing done right.

### 2. Labeling Problems (Buttons, Links, Forms)

**Critical Issues:**

- **MULTIPLE "Learn More" links with no context:** There are at least 6-7 links that just say "Learn More" with no additional context. When I pull up my links list or tab through them, I can't tell which service each "Learn More" link refers to. They should say:
  - "Learn More about AI Automation & Agentic AI"
  - "Learn More about Web Application Development"
  - "Learn More about Mobile Application Development"
  - etc.

- **Generic "Connect" link text:** The LinkedIn link just says "Connect" which doesn't tell me where it's connecting to. Should be "Connect with LaunchPad Lab on LinkedIn."

- **Repeated headings with same text:** The contact page H1 says "Ready to Build Something Great?" and then there's an H2 with the same text. The screen reader announces it twice and it sounds like an error.

- **Missing form labels:** The contact page mentions "Complete the form below" but I couldn't find any form fields. If the form exists, it might not have proper labels, or it might be implemented in a way that's not keyboard accessible.

### 3. Keyboard Accessibility Issues

**Problems:**

- **Can't find the contact form:** The page explicitly says "Complete the form below to tell us about your project" but when I tab through the entire contact page, I never encounter any form fields (text inputs, textareas, submit buttons). Either:
  - The form doesn't actually exist (misleading content)
  - The form is not keyboard accessible (major accessibility violation)
  - The form is hidden or loaded dynamically without proper focus management

This is a critical issue because I cannot contact them via the form if it's not keyboard accessible.

- **Tab order seems okay for what's there:** The links and interactive elements I could reach seemed to be in a logical tab order (top to bottom, left to right).

### 4. Missing or Unclear Alt Text

**Issues I Identified:**

- **Company logos have alt text:** The client logos (Harvard, Northwestern, Kawasaki, etc.) do have alt text with the company names, which is good.

- **Decorative icons likely missing alt or not marked as decorative:** There are numerous icons throughout the page (for services, problems, etc.). From the content structure, these icons don't seem to have meaningful alt text announced, OR they might be correctly marked as decorative (aria-hidden or empty alt). Without being able to test directly, I can't confirm, but decorative images should be hidden from screen readers.

- **Arrow icons in links:** The "Learn More" links have arrow icons (arrow-right-white.svg, arrow-right-black.svg). These probably don't have alt text, which is fine IF they're decorative. But the lack of descriptive link text is the bigger problem.

- **Case study screenshots:** Images like "Prosci Interface Screenshot" and "CDK Interface Screenshot" are announced with those alt texts, which is okay but not very informative. They could be more descriptive like "Screenshot of Prosci's 360-degree customer view interface in Salesforce."

- **Award badge images:** There are several award badge images at the bottom. They appear to have filenames like "Top-Clutch-Salesforce-Company-United-States-2025.png" but I can't tell if these have proper alt text. They should say something like "Clutch award badge: Top Salesforce Company in the United States 2025."

### 5. Moments Where I Felt Lost or Disoriented

**Specific Moments of Confusion:**

1. **When navigating headings and hearing duplicate H2s:** Every time I pressed H to jump to the next heading, I'd hear two H2s that seemed to say the same thing. I kept thinking "wait, am I going forward or did I go backward by mistake?" It broke my mental model of the page structure.

2. **When I encountered multiple "Learn More" links:** I tabbed to the first "Learn More" link and thought "okay, this is for AI Automation." Then I tabbed again and heard "Learn More, link" again. And again. And again. I lost count and lost track of which service each link belonged to. I had to stop and go back to read the surrounding context, which defeats the purpose of efficient keyboard navigation.

3. **When looking for the contact form:** The H1 on the contact page says "Complete the form below" so I expected to tab to a form immediately. Instead, I tabbed through testimonials, then more headings, then eventually the contact info. I kept thinking "where's the form??" and wondering if I somehow skipped over it. Eventually I realized it might not exist or might not be accessible.

4. **When statistics were announced as headings:** Hearing "Heading level 2, 12+" made me think "twelve what? Is this a section about the number 12?" Then I heard the following text "Years in Business" and realized it was a statistic. But it shouldn't have been a heading at all. It confused my mental outline of the page.

5. **Landing on the contact page:** When the contact page loaded, I heard "Ready to Build Something Great?" twice (once as H1, once as H2) and it made me wonder if the page loaded incorrectly or if there was duplicate content.

### 6. What Would Make This Easier to Navigate

**High Priority Fixes:**

✅ **Fix the duplicate H2 heading issue:** Each major section should have ONE heading, not two. If you have a section label and a subtitle, make the label an H2 and the subtitle regular text or an H3. For example:
- H2: "Our Services" 
- H3: "AI Automation & Agentic AI"
- H3: "Web Application Development"
(Instead of H2: "Driving ROI with AI" + H2: "Make AI Your Competitive Advantage" + H3: services)

✅ **Don't use headings for statistics:** The "12+ Years in Business" statistics should be in a `<dl>` (definition list) or just `<div>` elements, NOT headings. They're data points, not section headers.

✅ **Add descriptive text to "Learn More" links:** Change all "Learn More" links to include context:
- "Learn More about AI Automation & Agentic AI"
- "Learn More about Web Application Development"
- OR use aria-label: `<a href="..." aria-label="Learn more about AI Automation & Agentic AI">Learn More</a>`

✅ **Make the contact form keyboard accessible (or add one if it's missing):** If there's a form, ensure:
- All form fields have associated `<label>` elements
- The form is reachable via Tab key
- Required fields are marked with aria-required
- Error messages are associated with their fields
- The submit button is clearly labeled

✅ **Add proper ARIA landmarks:** Use semantic HTML5 elements:
- `<header>` for the site header/banner
- `<nav>` for navigation menus
- `<main>` for the main content area
- `<aside>` for sidebars if any
- `<footer>` for the site footer
This allows me to jump directly to sections using D key.

✅ **Improve link text specificity:** 
- Change "Connect" to "Connect on LinkedIn"
- Make all link text unique and descriptive

✅ **Fix heading hierarchy logic:** Organize headings properly:
- H1: Page title (one per page)
- H2: Major sections
- H3: Subsections within H2s
- H4: Sub-subsections within H3s
No skipping levels, no duplicate H2s for the same section.

✅ **Add better alt text for award badges:** Instead of just the filename, describe what the award is for: "2025 Clutch Top Salesforce Company award badge for United States"

✅ **Consider adding an accessibility statement:** Let users know you're committed to accessibility and provide a way to report issues.

✅ **Test with actual screen readers:** Have someone who uses NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver test the site. Automated tools miss a lot of what real users experience.

## Final Thoughts

I was able to complete my tasks - I figured out what LaunchPad Lab does and found their contact information. However, the experience was frustrating and inefficient.

The biggest issues were:
1. Confusing heading structure with duplicate H2s everywhere
2. Multiple "Learn More" links with no distinguishing text
3. A contact form that's either missing or not keyboard accessible

These aren't small issues - they significantly impact my ability to navigate efficiently. As a screen reader user, I rely on well-structured headings and descriptive link text to understand and navigate a site quickly. This site makes me work much harder than necessary.

The good news: these issues are fixable with relatively straightforward HTML and ARIA improvements. The site has a skip link (which many sites don't), and the content is generally present and readable. It just needs better semantic structure and labeling.

**Rating: 4/10 for screen reader accessibility**

The content is there, but the structure and labeling make navigation unnecessarily difficult. With the fixes listed above, this could easily become an 8/10 or better.
