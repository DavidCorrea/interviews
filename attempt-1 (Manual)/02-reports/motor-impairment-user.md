## My Experience Browsing LaunchPad Lab's Website

I wanted to learn about this company because we're looking for a development partner at work. The website loaded fine, but right away I noticed the navigation menu at the top has these links packed pretty close together. I had to be really careful moving my mouse between "Services" and "Work" - my hand shook and I kept almost clicking the wrong thing. Took me three tries to get to the right page because the links are so close.

The main page has this big blue button that says "Connect with an Expert" which was actually nice - big enough that I could hit it without worrying. But then further down, there are all these service cards with little "Learn More" links and tiny arrow icons next to them. I tried to click on "AI Automation" and missed twice. The arrow is so small and right next to the text that I couldn't tell if I was supposed to click the icon or the words. My cursor kept jumping around and I'd end up clicking empty space.

The "Problems We Solve" section was frustrating. There are these tabs or buttons at the top - "Operational Efficiency," "Modern Technology," etc. - and they're spaced so tightly together. I wanted to click "Customer Engagement" but I kept accidentally hitting "Modern Technology" instead. The hit areas feel too small and there's barely any space between them. My hand cramped up after trying to be so precise.

When I scrolled down to see the case studies with Prosci and CDK Global, those cards seemed okay size-wise, but again, the clickable areas felt small. I had to steady my wrist against the desk to try and click accurately.

I finally made it to the contact page by clicking one of the big "Let's Build Something Great" buttons at the bottom - those were easier because they're larger. But the contact form itself... ugh. The input fields are normal size I guess, but trying to type my name and email with tremors meant I kept hitting the wrong keys. Had to backspace a bunch. Then there's a dropdown menu for "What do you need help with?" and trying to click the exact option I wanted from that narrow list was a pain. The options are stacked with not much breathing room.

What really annoyed me was that I noticed some elements seem to change when you hover over them - like buttons getting slightly bigger or changing color. That's actually confusing because when my cursor shakes over something, it keeps triggering that change on and off. It's distracting and makes it harder to aim.

Also, I didn't see any obvious phone number on the first page. I had to dig around to find it on the contact page. Sometimes I just want to call someone instead of filling out forms - it's less exhausting than trying to type everything out precisely.

## What Does This Company Do?

From what I gathered, LaunchPad Lab is a tech company that builds custom software for businesses. They specialize in AI stuff - like automating tasks that people normally do - and they make web applications, mobile apps, and work with something called Salesforce. 

They seem to help companies that have old, clunky systems and need modern software to make things run smoother. They also do design work so the products look good and are easy to use (ironic, given my experience on their site...).

They've worked with big names like Harvard, Northwestern University, and Whirlpool. Been around since 2012, so they've got experience. They talk a lot about AI being a "competitive advantage" and helping businesses save money and work faster.

Basically, if your company needs custom software built or wants to use AI to automate work, these are the people you'd hire.

## Where/How to Contact Them

**Contact Page:** https://launchpadlab.com/contact/

There's a contact form on that page where you fill out your name, email, company info, and what you need help with. 

**Direct Contact Info:**
- **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com (this is probably easier for me than the form)
- **Phone:** (312) 888-9651 (would definitely prefer calling)
- **LinkedIn:** They have a company page you can reach them through

Throughout the site, there are blue buttons that say "Connect with an Expert" or "Let's Build Something Great" that all lead to the contact page.

## My Summary: Physical Challenges and Frustrations

### 1. Hard-to-Click Elements
- Navigation menu links are packed too close together at the top
- Small "Learn More" links with tiny arrow icons on service cards
- The "Problems We Solve" section tabs/buttons have very tight spacing
- Dropdown menus in the contact form with narrow options
- Clickable text links that are too small and blend together

### 2. Precision Problems
- Had to make multiple attempts to click small targets
- Arrow icons are too tiny - couldn't tell if I should click icon or text
- My tremors made me keep hitting the wrong navigation links
- Accidentally selected wrong options in dropdown menus
- Hover effects kept triggering on/off as my cursor shook, making aiming harder

### 3. Time Pressure Issues
- None that I noticed, which is good - no countdown timers or auto-submitting forms
- However, typing in the contact form still felt exhausting because of the length

### 4. What Would Reduce My Strain
- **Bigger click targets** - especially on navigation menus and those "Learn More" links. Just make everything bigger with more space around it.
- **More spacing between interactive elements** - the tabs and menu items need more breathing room so I'm not constantly misclicking
- **Remove or simplify hover effects** - they're just distracting when you have shaky hands
- **Bigger buttons everywhere** - the main CTA buttons were good, but secondary actions need to be larger too
- **Make entire cards clickable** - instead of tiny "Learn More" links, let me click anywhere on those service cards
- **Put phone number prominently on homepage** - I'd rather call than wrestle with a form when my hands are tired
- **Auto-fill friendly form fields** - or better yet, just ask for email and have someone reach out to me
- **Avoid dropdowns if possible** - radio buttons or larger checkbox options would be easier to click

The company seems legit and does good work, but I left their site feeling tired and frustrated. If they make software that's supposed to be easy to use, they should probably make their own website easier to navigate for people like me.
