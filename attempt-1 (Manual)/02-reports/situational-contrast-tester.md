## My Experience Browsing the Site

*I'm sitting outside at a coffee shop trying to look at this website, and the sun is hitting my screen at just the wrong angle...*

Okay, the page loaded. I can see there's a big headline at the top - "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." The text is dark enough that I can read it, thankfully. But wait, there's some smaller text underneath... I'm squinting. "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness..." - the body text is lighter gray and with this glare, it's really hard to make out. I'm tilting my screen back and forth trying to find an angle where I can read it.

There's a blue button that says "Connect with an Expert" - that stands out fine. The contrast on that is good enough even in this bright light.

Scrolling down... oh, there are company logos. Some of them are washing out completely. I can see Harvard and Northwestern because those have dark text, but some of the other logos are so faint I can barely tell they're there. The Prosci logo looks almost invisible against the white background in this sunlight.

Now I'm in a section with more text. "Your Strategic AI Partner" - that heading is readable. But the paragraph below it? Ugh, it's that light gray color again. I'm holding my hand up to shade the screen just so I can read "At LaunchPad Lab, we combine deep expertise..." This is exhausting.

Oh! There are six service boxes here. Let me see...
- AI Automation & Agentic AI
- Web Application Development  
- Mobile Application Development
- Salesforce Development
- Product Strategy & Design
- Managed Services & Support

The service names are in dark text so I can read those. But each one has a subtitle underneath - "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce," "Bespoke, redefining experiences" - and that text is SUPER light. In this bright light, it's almost disappearing. I can barely make out what these subtitles say.

Each box has a "Learn More" link with a little arrow icon. The problem is, some of these boxes look like they have subtle shading or borders to separate them, but in this glare, all that visual distinction is gone. Everything just blends together into one washed-out area. I can't really tell where one service box ends and another begins unless I look at the headings.

Keep scrolling... "Problems We Solve" section. There are more boxes with icons and text. The headings like "Operational Efficiency" and "Modern Technology" are dark enough to read. But again, the descriptive text underneath - "Streamline processes with digital products to enhance productivity" - is too light. I'm straining my eyes.

Oh, there are some images here too. They look washed out. I think they're supposed to be colorful illustrations but in this bright sunlight, they just look pale and faded. I can barely make out what they're showing.

Statistics section: "12+ Years in Business," "730+ Projects," "240+ Clients" - okay, those numbers are big and dark, I can see them. The explanatory text underneath is lighter though and harder to read.

More scrolling... there's a section about their process: "Discover, Deliver, Release." The main headings are fine, but there are bullet points with even MORE information in light gray text. In this lighting, I'm basically skipping over all of it because I just can't read it comfortably. My eyes are getting tired from squinting.

Case studies section - I can see company names like "Prosci" and "CDK Global" in their logos, but some of the statistics and details are in that lighter text color that's washing out. There are also screenshots of their work, but they look so pale and washed out in this sunlight that I can't really appreciate the designs.

At the bottom, there's a "Reach Out" section with "Let's Build Something Great." I need to find contact information, so let me click on that...

*Clicking to contact page*

New page loaded. "Ready to Build Something Great?" - I can read that headline.

Scrolling down past some testimonials (which have long gray text that I'm mostly skipping because it's too hard to read in this glare)...

Finally! "Let's Connect" section with contact info:
- **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com
- **Phone:** (312) 888-9651
- **LinkedIn:** There's a link

The contact information text is dark enough that I can read it! Thank goodness. The email and phone number are actually links (they're blue/black) so they have decent contrast.

But I have to say, getting to this point was a struggle. So much of the text on this site is in light gray that just disappears in bright outdoor lighting. If I were trying to actually understand what services they offer or read through their process, I'd have to give up and wait until I'm back indoors.

## What Does This Company Do?

Based on what I could actually read in this bright sunlight (mostly the dark headings and skipping the light-gray body text), LaunchPad Lab is a technology company that does:

1. **AI Automation** - something about digital workforce
2. **Web and Mobile App Development** - they build custom applications
3. **Salesforce Development** - they work with Salesforce software
4. **Product Strategy & Design** - they help plan digital products
5. **Managed Services** - ongoing support

They've been around for 12+ years, done over 730 projects, and worked with 240+ clients including big names like Harvard, Northwestern, and hospitals.

They help businesses with AI implementation and building custom software. They work on projects from planning through development to ongoing support.

Honestly, I had to piece this together from headings and the bits of text I could read. All the detailed explanations are in that light gray text that's nearly invisible out here in the sun, so I'm missing a lot of the nuance about what they actually do.

## Where and How to Contact Them

**Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
**Phone:** (312) 888-9651  
**LinkedIn:** They have a company page on LinkedIn

These are on the Contact page: https://launchpadlab.com/contact/

The contact information was actually readable because it's in dark text or blue link color. That was one of the few parts of the site where the contrast was strong enough for me to read easily in this bright light.

## My Summary - Outdoor Sunlight Experience

### 1. Washed-Out Elements

**Company Logos:**
- The client logo section had about 12 company logos displayed. In this bright sunlight, many of them completely washed out against the white background. I could see Harvard and Northwestern because they use dark text, but several others (like Prosci, Whirlpool, and some of the other logos) were so faint I could barely tell they were there. They need stronger outlines or darker colors to be visible outdoors.

**Service Box Descriptions:**
- Under each service name (AI Automation, Web Development, etc.), there's a subtitle/tagline in light gray text: "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce," "Bespoke, redefining experiences," etc. In the sunlight, these practically disappeared. I could read the service names but not the descriptions.

**Body Paragraphs:**
- Throughout the site, there are explanatory paragraphs in light gray text (probably #666666 or #777777 or something similar). In bright outdoor light, this gray is far too light. The text becomes almost unreadable. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs because I couldn't make them out without straining my eyes.

**Images and Illustrations:**
- The decorative images and screenshots throughout the site looked extremely washed out. They probably have nice colors and details indoors, but outside in the sun, they just look like pale, faded blobs. I couldn't appreciate any of the design work in their case study screenshots.

**Subtle Shadows and Borders:**
- Many sections seemed to rely on subtle box shadows or light borders to create visual separation. All of that disappeared in the bright light. Everything just blended together into one continuous white surface with text on it.

### 2. Buttons That Blended Into Background

**"Learn More" Links:**
- Each service box has a "Learn More" link at the bottom. These appear to be styled as subtle text links (possibly with a small arrow icon). In normal lighting, they probably look clean and modern. But in bright sunlight, they didn't have enough contrast to stand out as clickable elements. If they have a subtle hover state or outline, I couldn't see it at all in this glare.

**Secondary Call-to-Action Buttons:**
- If there were any secondary buttons with subtle or outline-only styling (like ghost buttons with just a border and no fill), they would be completely invisible to me in this lighting. Luckily, the main CTA "Connect with an Expert" was a solid blue button that had enough contrast to see.

**Icon-Only Buttons:**
- Some sections had small arrow icons that appear to be clickable. The little arrow icons next to "Learn More" links were so subtle that in bright light, I wasn't sure if they were decorative or functional. If buttons rely only on icons without text labels and without strong contrast, they effectively disappear outdoors.

### 3. Hard-to-Read Text

**All Light Gray Body Text:**
- This is the biggest issue. Any text that isn't pure black or very dark gray is incredibly difficult to read in bright sunlight. Specific examples:
  - The introductory paragraph under the main headline
  - Service descriptions under each service name
  - The entire "At LaunchPad Lab, we combine deep expertise..." paragraph
  - Problem descriptions under "Operational Efficiency," "Modern Technology," etc.
  - Process step descriptions under "Discover, Deliver, Release"
  - Testimonial quotes (those long paragraphs of client feedback)
  - Statistics explanations under the numbers

I estimate that 60-70% of the text content on the site is in this light gray color that becomes unreadable in bright outdoor conditions.

**Small Text:**
- Even when text had okay contrast, if it was small in size AND light in color, it became doubly hard to read. For example, some of the fine print or less important text was both small and gray - completely illegible outdoors.

**White/Light Text on Images:**
- In a few places, there seemed to be white or light-colored text overlaid on photos or colored backgrounds. In bright sunlight, if the background image washed out, the text disappeared along with it.

### 4. Areas Needing Stronger Contrast

**Priority Fixes:**

1. **Body Text Color** (CRITICAL):
   - Change all body text from light gray (#666, #777, or similar) to a much darker gray or pure black (#333 or #000). This single change would make the biggest difference. Body text should have AT LEAST a 7:1 contrast ratio with the background for comfortable reading in all conditions.

2. **Service Box Descriptions**:
   - The taglines under each service name need to be much darker. Currently they're decorative and unreadable. Either make them dark gray/black or remove them if they're not essential.

3. **Button and Link Styling**:
   - All interactive elements (buttons, links) need strong contrast. Don't rely on subtle borders or hover states. Use solid backgrounds or very dark text colors. If using icon buttons, add text labels or ensure the icons are large and high-contrast.

4. **Section Separators**:
   - Instead of subtle shadows or light borders to separate sections, use stronger visual dividers: darker borders, more white space, or alternating background colors with clear contrast.

5. **Images and Graphics**:
   - Consider adding darker borders or frames around images so they don't wash out completely. Or ensure images have high contrast internal elements so some detail remains visible even in bright light.

6. **Statistics and Important Numbers**:
   - The numbers themselves (12+, 730+, 240+) are readable, but the explanatory text underneath is too light. Make that text darker or bolder.

7. **Testimonials**:
   - The long quote blocks are in light gray text. These should be darker, especially since testimonials are important social proof. Use dark gray or black for quote text.

8. **Logo Section**:
   - Client logos that are light-colored or have subtle gradients wash out completely. Consider adding a subtle dark border around logo images or displaying them on a very light gray background (instead of pure white) to add some definition.

9. **Form Elements** (if present):
   - Any form fields with light gray placeholder text or subtle borders would be invisible. Ensure form borders are dark and clear, and labels are in high-contrast text.

10. **Hover/Focus States**:
    - Don't rely solely on subtle color changes for interactive feedback. Use underlines, bold text, or significant color shifts that will be visible even in poor viewing conditions.

## Final Thoughts

Look, I get that light gray text and subtle shadows are trendy in modern web design. They look elegant and sophisticated on a nice indoor monitor. But out here in the real world - literally, outside in the sunshine - this design completely falls apart.

I managed to figure out what the company does and find their contact info, but only because I could read the dark headings and skip over everything else. If I actually needed to understand their services in detail or read through their process, I would have had to bookmark the site and come back later when I'm indoors.

The main problem is simple: **too much light gray text on white backgrounds**. In bright light with screen glare, that combination becomes unreadable.

The fix is also simple: **use darker text**. Black or very dark gray (#333) for body text. Reserve light gray only for truly optional content like fine print, and even then, go darker than you think you need to.

Other situational users who would struggle with this site:
- Anyone using a cheap laptop or old phone with a dim screen
- Anyone in a brightly lit office near windows
- Anyone with a matte screen protector that reduces contrast
- Anyone with any degree of vision impairment

**My rating: 3/10 for outdoor/bright light usability**

The structure and content are there, but the visual presentation assumes perfect indoor viewing conditions. One global CSS change (darkening body text) would probably improve this to 7/10 or 8/10.

Make it darker. Your eyes will thank you. My eyes certainly would have.
