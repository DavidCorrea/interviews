## My Experience Browsing the Site

Okay, so I opened the website and... wow. There's a LOT of text everywhere. The first thing I see is "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development" - I had to read that three times. My brain kept mixing up "Centric" and "Digital" and "Development" - they all start with hard letters and look similar.

The main headline says "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." Short sentences! That's good. But then right under it there's this huge paragraph:

"LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."

I... I had to stop. That sentence is too long. I read "harness" as "harvest" the first time. Then "tailored" and "execution" got jumbled. By the time I got to the end, I forgot what the beginning was about.

I scrolled down fast because there was too much text. I saw logos - Harvard, Northwestern, hospitals. That's easier to understand. Pictures are good.

Then another section: "Your Strategic AI Partner" with ANOTHER big paragraph underneath. I skipped it. My eyes were already tired.

The services section is better! They have boxes with short titles:
- AI Automation & Agentic AI
- Web Application Development
- Mobile Application Development
- Salesforce Development
- Product Strategy & Design
- Managed Services & Support

That's clearer! But wait... "Agentic"? Is that even a word? And under each one there's little phrases like "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce" and "Bespoke, redefining experiences" - I don't understand what those mean. Too fancy.

I kept scrolling. There's a section called "Problems We Solve" with "Ship Game-Changing Digital Products to Market Fast" - okay, that title is kinda clear. But then:

"By forging a partnership rather than a mere service agreement, we collaborate on the unique challenges and opportunities your business faces."

My brain hurts. "Forging" made me think of blacksmiths. And the sentence is so long with so many words that look similar - "partnership," "challenges," "business," "faces" - they all blur together.

The bullet points underneath are better:
- Operational Efficiency
- Modern Technology
- Customer Engagement
- Scalable Solutions
- Expansive Resources
- Speed to Market

Bullet points help! But some of these words are hard. "Scalable" - I keep reading it as "scale-able" or "sca-lable" and getting confused.

Then there's numbers! "12+ Years in Business" and "730+ Projects" - numbers are good, I can read those quickly.

The "Our Signature Approach" section has a long paragraph that I skipped completely. It looked too dense. But then there's sections labeled:
- Discover
- Deliver
- Release

Those are clear! Short words!

I finally found the contact info after scrolling a lot. The contact page is actually easier to read because there's less text crammed everywhere. I found:
- Email: contact@launchpadlab.com
- Phone: (312) 888-9651
- LinkedIn link

That part was simple and clear.

I also clicked on the "Web App Development" page. Same problem - HUGE paragraphs everywhere. Like this one:

"We help turn complex ideas into intuitive, scalable web applications that solve real business problems. Whether you're replacing legacy systems, building new revenue channels, or creating a platform your customers love using—we make it happen, fast."

I read "intuitive" as "initiative" first. And the sentence with three things separated by commas made me lose track. My eyes kept jumping around.

The testimonials page has long quotes in italics. Italic text is SO HARD to read. The letters get all swirly and I can't tell them apart. I skipped most of them.

## What Does This Company Do?

From what I could understand (reading slowly and skipping the really dense parts):

LaunchPad Lab is a technology company. They make:

1. **Websites and apps** - custom ones for businesses
2. **AI tools** - robots or automation to help companies work faster
3. **Salesforce stuff** - I don't fully understand what Salesforce is, but they work with it
4. **Phone apps** - apps for mobile phones
5. **Support services** - they help after building things

They've been around since 2012 (over 12 years) and worked with over 240 companies. Big names like Harvard and Northwestern University.

The main idea is: they build custom computer software and AI things for businesses to help them work better and make more money.

They say they can start projects quickly and help companies with their technology problems.

## My Summary as Someone with Dyslexia

### 1. Hard-to-Read Sections

**The worst sections for me:**

- **The opening paragraph on the homepage** - "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."
  - Too long, too many complex words packed together

- **"Your Strategic AI Partner" section** - Dense paragraph with words like "expertise," "consulting," "challenges," "cross-functional," "organization" all close together

- **"Problems We Solve" intro paragraph** - "By forging a partnership rather than a mere service agreement, we collaborate on the unique challenges and opportunities your business faces..."
  - Words like "forging," "collaborate," "unique," "challenges" all blend together

- **"Our Signature Approach" paragraph** - "The LaunchPad Lab team supports every stage in the digital product development lifecycle. Prioritizing communication and quality, we help clients accelerate speed-to-market and deliver outcomes for their most important digital transformation initiatives."
  - Way too many big words in one sentence. "Prioritizing," "accelerate," "transformation," "initiatives" all look similar

- **All the testimonials** - They're in italics which makes them really hard to read. The swirly letters get all jumbled

- **FAQ answers** - Long paragraphs in the FAQ section. I wanted quick answers but got walls of text

### 2. Words or Phrases That Tripped Me Up

**Words that confused me or I misread:**

- **"AI-Centric"** - My brain kept seeing "Central" or "entric" separately
- **"Harness"** - I read as "harvest" multiple times
- **"Tailored"** - Looks like "tailed" or "trailer" to me
- **"Bespoke"** - My eyes saw "be spoke" or "bespo-ke"
- **"Agentic"** - Is this even a real word? I kept trying to read it as "agentistic" or "agency"
- **"Forging"** - I think of blacksmiths, not partnerships
- **"Scalable"** - I keep breaking it up wrong: "sca-lable" or "scale-able"
- **"Autonomous"** - Too many vowels, gets jumbled. "Auto-no-mous"?
- **"Intuitive"** - I read as "initiative" the first time
- **"Operational"** - Looks like "opera-tional," I separate it wrong
- **"Collaborate"** - Similar to "corporate," I mix them up
- **"Transformative"** - Too long, "trans-form-ative" - lost the meaning
- **"Streamline"** - "Stream-line"? Like water? Confusing
- **"Seamless"** - Looks like "sea-mless" or "seam-less"
- **"Leverage"** - Read as "lever-age" - what does that mean?
- **"Ecosystem"** - "Eco-system" - environment? Technology?
- **"Codification"** - Way too long and technical
- **"Prioritizing"** - "Pri-or-it-iz-ing" - too many syllables

**Phrase patterns that were hard:**

- Long hyphenated phrases like "customer-facing," "cross-functional," "cloud-native," "data-driven" - the hyphen breaks my reading flow
- Words ending in "-tion" all look the same: execution, automation, optimization, transformation
- Words starting with "com-" blur together: competitive, communicate, collaborate, complex
- Business jargon phrases that use metaphors: "harness the power," "forging partnerships," "unlock growth," "pull ahead"

### 3. Layouts That Were Overwhelming

**What made pages hard to navigate:**

- **Dense text blocks** - So many sections with thick paragraphs crammed with long words. No breathing room
- **Too much text before getting to the point** - I had to scroll through paragraphs before understanding what they actually do
- **Mixed fonts and sizes** - Some headers are big, some are small, body text varies - makes it hard to track what's important
- **Italic text in testimonials** - Italics are incredibly hard for dyslexic readers. The slanted letters blend and jump around
- **Long sentences in body text** - Sentences with 20+ words, multiple commas, and complex structure make me lose my place
- **Sections run together** - Hard to tell where one section ends and another begins. Needs more visual separation
- **Small line spacing** - When lines are too close together, my eyes jump to the wrong line
- **Justified text** - If any sections use justified alignment (text flush on both sides), the uneven spacing makes words harder to track
- **Too many different sections** - The homepage has like 10 different sections all with different content. By the time I got to the bottom, I forgot what the top said
- **Case study sections with small text** - The project descriptions have small text with lots of details crammed in
- **FAQs with long answers** - I wanted quick info but got paragraphs

**Specific layout issues:**

- The services grid has 6 boxes all with similar formatting - I had to reread each one because they blurred together
- The "Problems We Solve" section has 6 boxes in a row - too many to process at once
- Statistics are mixed in with text instead of standing out clearly
- The navigation menu probably has many options (hard to track in my mind)

### 4. What Formatting Would Help

**What would make this site easier for me:**

#### Text Changes:
- **Shorter sentences** - Max 10-15 words per sentence
- **Shorter paragraphs** - 2-3 sentences max, then add space
- **Simple words** - Use "custom" instead of "bespoke," "help" instead of "harness," "work together" instead of "collaborate"
- **No italics** - Use bold or regular text instead. Italics are torture
- **Larger font size** - Current size feels small, especially for body text
- **More line spacing** - Space between lines (1.5 or 2.0 line height) helps my eyes track
- **Left-aligned text ONLY** - Never center or justify body text
- **Sans-serif font** - A clean font like Arial, Verdana, or Comic Sans (yes, Comic Sans is actually good for dyslexia!)

#### Layout Changes:
- **More white space** - Space between sections, around text, everywhere
- **Clear visual breaks** - Use lines, colors, or big gaps to show where sections change
- **Bullet points instead of paragraphs** - Lists are so much easier to read
- **One idea per paragraph** - Don't combine multiple concepts in one block
- **Highlight key words** - Use bold (not italic) to emphasize important terms
- **Color to separate sections** - Use background colors or borders to clearly divide areas
- **Bigger headers** - Make section titles really stand out so I know where I am
- **Icons or images for each section** - Visual cues help me remember and navigate

#### Content Structure:
- **Summary at the top** - Start each page with a 2-3 bullet point summary of what you'll learn
- **Short answers first** - In FAQs, give a 1-sentence answer, THEN expand if needed
- **Key info in boxes** - Put contact info, main services, etc. in clearly bordered boxes
- **Consistent layout** - Keep the same structure on every page so I learn where things are
- **Visual hierarchy** - Use size/color/weight to show what's most important

#### Specific Fixes for This Site:
- **Simplify the homepage headline** - Instead of "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development," try "We Build Custom Apps and AI Tools"
- **Replace the opening paragraph** with bullets:
  - We build websites and mobile apps
  - We create AI automation tools
  - We help businesses use technology better
- **Break up service descriptions** - Each service should have 3-5 bullet points, not paragraphs
- **Put contact info at the top AND bottom** - Make it super easy to find
- **Use bold for key terms, not italics** - Make important words bold and slightly larger
- **Add a "Quick Summary" box** at the top of each page with:
  - What is this page about?
  - Key services/info
  - How to contact you
- **Reduce the number of sections on the homepage** - Maybe 5 sections instead of 10+
- **Make testimonials shorter** - Pull out just one key sentence from each, make it bold and regular (not italic)
- **Use dyslexia-friendly fonts** - OpenDyslexic, Comic Sans, Arial, or Verdana
- **Add a "Skip to Contact" button** at the top for people like me who just want to reach out

## Final Thoughts

I eventually figured out what LaunchPad Lab does and found their contact information, but it took a lot of effort and rereading. I had to skip probably 40% of the text because it was too dense and used too many complex words.

The information is there, but it's buried in long paragraphs with difficult vocabulary and similar-looking words. For someone with dyslexia, this site is exhausting to read.

The good parts were:
- Short section headers
- Bullet point lists (when they used them)
- Company logos and images
- Simple contact information
- Numbers and statistics

The hard parts were:
- Long paragraphs everywhere
- Complex business jargon
- Words that look similar crammed together
- Italic text in testimonials
- Not enough white space
- Too many sections with dense information

If they simplified the language, broke up the text into smaller chunks, used more bullet points, and added more white space, this site would be SO much easier for people like me to understand.

Right now, I feel like I worked really hard to get basic information that should have been simple to find.
