## My Experience Browsing the Site

When I first landed on the LaunchPad Lab homepage, I noticed the site uses a lot of different colors throughout. As someone with tritanopia, I always pay attention to whether I can distinguish between different elements, especially links and important information.

The main headline "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." was clear enough - it looks like it's in a dark color against a light background, so no issues there.

I saw a button that said "Connect with an Expert" - it appeared to be in some kind of accent color, maybe blue or teal? It stood out from the background, which is good, but I'm always a bit uncertain about exactly what color things are supposed to be.

As I scrolled down, there were several sections with company logos - Harvard, Northwestern, hospitals, etc. Those were mostly in grayscale or dark colors, so they were easy to see.

Then I got to the services section with six boxes:
- AI Automation & Agentic AI
- Web Application Development  
- Mobile Application Development
- Salesforce Development
- Product Strategy & Design
- Managed Services & Support

Each box had an icon and text with "Learn More" links. The boxes looked like they had some kind of colored backgrounds or borders, but I couldn't really tell if they were using different colors to categorize them. If they were trying to group services by color (like "blue boxes for technical services, green boxes for consulting"), I completely missed that. They mostly all looked similar to me - maybe some were slightly lighter or darker than others, but no clear color distinction.

The "Learn More" links appeared to be in some color - probably blue? That's typically what websites use. But here's my problem: if I've already visited one of these links and come back, I have no idea which ones I've clicked on before. Visited links are usually purple, but blue and purple look basically identical to me. So if I'm trying to remember "which services did I already read about?" I can't use the link color to tell me. I'd have to remember on my own or click and see if the page looks familiar.

Further down the page, there were sections about "Problems We Solve" with more boxes showing things like:
- Operational Efficiency
- Modern Technology  
- Customer Engagement
- Scalable Solutions
- Expansive Resources
- Speed to Market

Again, each had an icon and some kind of background treatment. If they're using different colors for each category, I can't distinguish them. They all kind of blend together visually. I have to rely entirely on reading the text to understand what's what.

Then there was a section with statistics: "12+ Years in Business," "730+ Projects," "240+ Clients." These seemed to be in a consistent color scheme, which is fine. At least they're not trying to use color to differentiate between them.

The "Our Signature Approach" section had three phases: Discover, Deliver, Release. If these are color-coded (like green for Discover, blue for Deliver, yellow for Release), I wouldn't be able to tell. They might all look the same grayish-blue-green to me. I'd need the text labels to know which is which.

There was also a section showing case studies with screenshots of interfaces they built. Some of these screenshots had charts or data visualizations in them. I noticed one screenshot that looked like it might have a chart with different colored bars or lines. If that chart uses blue and green to show different data series, I wouldn't be able to tell them apart. They'd look like basically the same color. I'd need the chart to have labels, patterns, or icons to distinguish the data.

At the bottom, there were some award badge images. These often use color (gold, silver, bronze, or company brand colors). I could see the shapes and read any text on them, but if the color itself is meant to convey something (like "top tier" vs "honorable mention"), I'd miss that.

When I clicked through to the Contact page, I saw it had a form (or said it would have a form) and then contact details:
- Email: contact@launchpadlab.com  
- Phone: (312) 888-9651
- LinkedIn link

The contact information seemed to be presented clearly with icons and text. The links were probably in that standard blue color again. Same issue as before - if I've visited the email link or phone link already, I can't tell by color if they've changed to purple.

One thing I didn't notice on the site: any warning messages, error messages, or alert boxes. But if they exist and they're using yellow or light blue to indicate warnings, I might not see them clearly. Yellow often looks very pale or washed out to me, almost like white or very light gray. If there's a yellow banner at the top of the page saying "This site uses cookies" or "Your session is about to expire," I might completely miss it because it doesn't stand out against a white background.

Similarly, if there are any green success messages (like "Form submitted successfully!") and blue informational messages (like "Please review your information"), those might look identical to me. I'd need the message to have an icon (checkmark for success, info symbol for informational) or different text styling to distinguish them.

## My Summary as a Blue-Yellow Color Blind User

### 1. Link State Visibility Problems

**Major Issue: Cannot distinguish visited vs unvisited links**

This is my biggest frustration on this site (and most sites, honestly). Links are probably blue when unvisited and purple when visited. But to me, blue and purple look almost identical - they're both just... dark-ish links.

**Specific problems:**
- The six "Learn More" links for different services: Once I click on one and come back to the homepage, I have no idea which services I've already explored and which I haven't. They all look the same.
- Blog post links in the "Related Content" section: Same issue - can't tell which articles I've read before.
- Case study links: If I'm browsing through multiple case studies, I can't track which ones I've already visited.

**What would help:**
- Add a visual indicator beyond just color. For example:
  - Put a checkmark icon next to visited links
  - Use a strikethrough or underline style for visited links  
  - Change the font weight (bold to normal, or vice versa)
  - Add text like "(viewed)" next to visited links
- Or, make the color contrast MUCH stronger - not blue vs purple, but maybe blue vs red, or blue vs gray

### 2. Warning or Alert Visibility Issues

**Potential Issue: Yellow warnings would be nearly invisible**

I didn't see any warning or alert messages during my visit, but based on how most websites work, I'm concerned about:

- **Cookie notices:** If there's a yellow or light blue banner at the top saying "This site uses cookies," I might not notice it at all. Yellow looks very washed out to me, almost white.
- **Form validation errors:** If I filled out the contact form and made a mistake, an error message in yellow would be hard to see. It needs to be red or have a bold red border, plus an icon like an exclamation point.
- **Session timeout warnings:** A yellow "You will be logged out in 2 minutes" message would be invisible to me.
- **Success messages:** Green success messages might look similar to blue informational messages. I'd need icons to tell them apart (checkmark = success, "i" icon = info).

**What would help:**
- Never rely on color alone for warnings or alerts
- Use clear icons: ❌ for errors, ⚠️ for warnings, ✓ for success, ℹ️ for info
- Use strong text like "ERROR:" or "SUCCESS:" at the beginning of messages
- Use bold borders and sufficient color contrast (not subtle pastels)

### 3. Chart Color Confusion

**Likely Issue: Blue vs Green data would look identical**

I saw some case study screenshots that appeared to have charts or data visualizations in them. I can't see the actual colors clearly from the text-based view, but I'm very familiar with this problem:

**If charts use blue and green:**
- Two lines on a line chart, one blue and one green, would look like the same color to me
- Bar charts with blue and green bars would be indistinguishable
- Pie charts with blue and green slices would blend together
- Heatmaps using blue-to-green gradients would look like one flat color

**What I saw that concerned me:**
- The case study screenshots might have dashboards or analytics interfaces
- If those interfaces use blue/green color schemes (very common in data viz), they'd be unusable for me
- The "increase" icons next to some statistics might be using green to indicate positive growth, but I can't tell

**What would help:**
- Use patterns or textures in addition to color (stripes, dots, hatching)
- Label data points directly on charts instead of using a color legend
- Use high-contrast color pairs (like orange vs blue, red vs blue, black vs white)
- Provide data tables alongside charts as an alternative way to access the information

### 4. Elements That Blended Together

**Specific examples from the site:**

**Service boxes:** The six service boxes (AI Automation, Web Dev, Mobile Dev, etc.) might be using different colored backgrounds or borders to categorize them. If so, I couldn't tell. They all looked like similar shades of grayish-blue or grayish-green. I had to read every single text label to understand them - couldn't quickly scan by color.

**"Problems We Solve" boxes:** Same issue - six different problem categories, possibly with different accent colors, but they all looked the same to me. No quick visual scanning possible.

**Process phases (Discover, Deliver, Release):** If these are color-coded to show progression or different types of work, I missed it entirely. They might all be the same light blue or light green for all I know.

**Call-to-action buttons:** The "Connect with an Expert" button and other action buttons might be using a specific brand color (teal? bright blue?), but I can't be certain. They stand out from the background, which is good, but I couldn't tell you what color they actually are.

**Award badges:** The various award badges at the bottom probably use color to indicate achievement level or to match different organizations' brands. I can see the shapes and any text, but the colors don't give me information.

**Background sections:** Some sections of the page probably have subtle colored backgrounds to separate them visually. If those are using light blue, light green, or pale yellow, they all look like very faint gray to me. I might not notice that one section is supposed to be visually distinct from another.

**Links in body text:** If there are links embedded in paragraphs of text, I need them to be underlined or bolded, not just a different color. Blue text in black text looks only slightly different to me - not enough to obviously say "this is clickable."

## Additional Observations

**What the site did WELL for color blindness:**

- **Good use of text labels:** Everything important has a text label, not just a colored icon. I never had to guess what something was based solely on color.

- **Icons with text:** The service boxes, problem categories, and contact methods all have icons AND text labels together. The icons provide a shape/symbol clue beyond just color.

- **Sufficient contrast (mostly):** The main text appears to be dark on light backgrounds, which gives good contrast. I can read everything easily.

- **Company logos:** The client logos were mostly grayscale or high-contrast, so they were easy to distinguish.

**What could be improved:**

- **Visited link states:** This is critical. Add something beyond color change.

- **If color-coding is used for categories, add patterns or icons:** Don't make me rely on seeing the difference between blue and green boxes to understand your navigation or services.

- **Test any data visualizations:** If there are charts or graphs in case studies or service pages, make sure they don't rely solely on blue vs green.

- **Make buttons more distinct:** Use high-contrast colors for calls-to-action. Red, orange, or strong purple would stand out more than blue or teal to me.

- **Add texture or patterns to backgrounds:** If sections have colored backgrounds for visual separation, consider also using subtle patterns, borders, or spacing to make the separation clear even without color perception.

## Final Thoughts

I was able to complete my tasks - I figured out what LaunchPad Lab does and found their contact information. The site is definitely usable for someone with my type of color blindness.

However, I know I'm missing some of the visual design choices they've made. If they're using color to create visual hierarchy, group related items, or show progression, I'm not getting that information. I'm relying 100% on text and layout.

The biggest practical issue is not being able to tell which links I've already visited. This makes navigation frustrating because I'm constantly re-clicking on things I've already seen.

Overall, the site is functional but not optimized for color blind users. With a few adjustments (visited link indicators, icons for status messages, alternative ways to distinguish categories), it could be much better.

**Rating: 6/10 for tritanopia accessibility**

I can use it, but I'm working harder than I need to, and I'm missing visual cues that make the experience smoother for people with typical color vision.
