## My Experience Browsing the Site

*Deep breath... okay, let me try to figure out what this website is about. I've zoomed in to 250% like my grandson showed me so I can actually read things...*

### First Impressions

The page loaded and... oh my. There's so much happening. I can see a big headline at the top that says "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." 

What does that even mean? AI is that robot thing they talk about on the news, right? I'm already feeling confused and I just got here.

There's a blue button that says "Connect with an Expert" but I'm not ready to click anything yet. What if it asks me for my credit card? What if it's a scam? I need to figure out what this company does first.

### Trying to Scroll and Read

With my zoom at 250%, I can only see a small portion of the page at a time. It's like looking through a narrow window. I have to scroll horizontally AND vertically to see everything, and I keep losing my place. Where was I? What section am I in now?

The text underneath the headline says something about "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting..." - I have to read this three times. "Harness"? "Tailored"? These are fancy words. Why can't they just say what they do in plain English?

I'm scrolling down slowly... my hand is shaking a bit today so the mouse keeps jumping around. I accidentally click on something - oh no! - but nothing happened, thank goodness.

### Company Logos Section

Now I see a bunch of company logos. Harvard, Northwestern, some hospital... okay, so they work with big organizations. That's somewhat reassuring. At least they're not completely unknown. But I still don't know what they DO for these places.

### The Services Section - Overwhelming!

Oh dear. Now there are six boxes with different services:

1. AI Automation & Agentic AI
2. Web Application Development
3. Mobile Application Development
4. Salesforce Development
5. Product Strategy & Design
6. Managed Services & Support

Each one has a "Learn More" button. That's SIX things I could click on. Which one do I need? What's the difference between them? 

And what on earth is "Agentic AI"? That's not even a real word, is it? "Bespoke"? "Agile, cross-functional"? This is like reading a foreign language.

With my zoom, I can only see about 2 of these boxes at a time on my screen. I have to scroll sideways to see the others, and they're arranged in a grid that breaks apart strangely when zoomed in. It's very disorienting.

The "Learn More" buttons are quite small even with my zoom. I try to click on one with my shaky hand, but I keep missing it and clicking on the text above it instead. It takes me three tries to actually hit the button.

### More Scrolling - Getting Tired

I keep scrolling down. There's a section called "Problems We Solve" with MORE boxes. Six more! Each with a title and description. I'm only seeing pieces of them as I scroll sideways and down. The layout is completely broken at this zoom level - things are stacking on top of each other in weird ways.

The text in these sections is getting smaller and lighter in color. Even with my zoom, it's hard to read. Gray text on a white background - why do they do that? Don't they know some of us don't see well?

### Statistics Section

I see some numbers: "12+ Years in Business," "730+ Projects," "240+ Clients." Okay, those are big numbers. That's good, I suppose. They've been around a while. But again, I STILL don't really understand what they do.

### Process Section - Completely Lost

"Our Signature Approach: Discover, Deliver, Release"

Under each of these, there are more bullet points with things like:
- "Align on scope, priorities, including outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept"
- "Build iteratively with bi-weekly sprint releases"
- "UAT validation"

I... I don't understand any of this. What is "UAT"? What's a "sprint release"? Is this in English? I feel like I'm reading a technical manual. This is making me feel stupid.

At this zoom level, these nested bullet points are a mess. They're overlapping, text is cutting off the edge of my screen, and I can't tell which bullets belong to which heading.

### Trust Concerns Emerging

I'm scrolling past all these technical terms and case studies and awards, and I'm starting to worry. Is this even a legitimate company? All these fancy words - are they trying to confuse people on purpose? Scammers use complicated language to trick people, don't they?

There are mentions of "Download Our Guide" in one section. Download? That sounds dangerous. What if it's a virus? My daughter told me to be very careful about downloading things.

### Desperately Looking for Contact Information

I just want to find a phone number. A real person I can talk to. Someone who can explain this to me in simple terms.

I scroll all the way to the bottom of the page. There's a section that says "Reach Out - Let's Build Something Great" but it just says "Get in touch with one of our experts today!" Where? How? I don't see a phone number!

### Finally Finding the Contact Page

I see the blue "Connect with an Expert" button again. I'm hesitant... but I really need to find contact information. I click it carefully, trying to steady my hand.

A new page loads. "Ready to Build Something Great?"

Oh no. It says "Complete the form below to tell us about your project."

A FORM? They want me to fill out a form? I'm already stressed just trying to understand what this company does. Now I have to type things in? With my shaky hands? And what information are they going to ask for? My email? My phone number? What if they sell my information?

I'm seriously considering just closing this browser tab right now.

### Finding Hope - Actual Contact Information

But wait... I keep scrolling down the contact page (so much scrolling!), past some long testimonials that I'm too tired to read, and finally - FINALLY - I see:

**"Let's Connect"**

And underneath:
- **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com
- **Call:** (312) 888-9651

Oh, thank heavens! A phone number! That's what I needed. I can just call them during business hours and talk to a real person. That's so much better than filling out a form or trying to figure out this website.

The phone number is displayed in a decent size and is a clickable link. At least that's helpful.

## What Does This Company Do?

Okay, after spending what feels like half an hour scrolling through this confusing website, here's what I THINK they do:

LaunchPad Lab is some kind of computer technology company. They help businesses with:

1. **Something with AI and computers** - They kept mentioning AI and automation everywhere. I think they help companies use those AI robots or programs to do work automatically?

2. **Building websites and phone apps** - They mentioned "web application development" and "mobile application development." So they make websites and apps for businesses.

3. **Salesforce** - This word came up a lot. I think it's some kind of business software? They help companies use it?

4. **Planning and support** - They help businesses plan their computer projects and then support them afterwards.

They've been in business since 2012 (so about 13-14 years), and they've worked with over 240 companies including universities and hospitals. That part makes me feel a bit better - if Harvard and Northwestern trust them, maybe they're legitimate.

But honestly, I'm not entirely sure what "AI consulting" or "digital product development" really means in practical terms. Do they fix computers? Do they sell software? Do they teach people how to use technology? It's all very vague and technical.

If I actually needed their services, I would call the phone number and ask them to explain in simple terms what they do.

## Where and How to Contact Them

**Phone Number:** (312) 888-9651  
**Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
**LinkedIn:** They have a business profile on LinkedIn

This information is on their Contact page: https://launchpadlab.com/contact/

I'm relieved they have a phone number. That's the only way I'd feel comfortable contacting them. I do NOT want to fill out their form because:
- I don't know what information they're asking for
- I don't trust giving my personal information to websites
- I have a tremor and typing is difficult for me
- Forms stress me out

A phone call is much better. I can ask questions, get clear answers, and decide if I trust them before giving any information.

## My Summary - Stressed User Experience

### 1. Visual Issues at Zoom

**The Layout Falls Apart at 250% Zoom:**

At my 250% zoom level (which I need to read comfortably), this website becomes almost unusable:

- **Horizontal scrolling everywhere:** I have to scroll left and right constantly to see content. Most websites don't make you do this. With my low vision and shaky hands, this is exhausting and disorienting.

- **Grid layouts break:** The six service boxes are arranged in a grid. At my zoom level, they stack awkwardly - sometimes one and a half boxes visible, sometimes two. I lose track of which box I'm looking at.

- **Text cuts off:** Several times, text would cut off at the edge of my screen mid-sentence. I'd have to scroll right to see the rest, read it, then scroll back left to continue reading down the page. I kept losing my place.

- **Overlapping elements:** In some sections, text and images would overlap at high zoom. I couldn't tell what was a heading versus body text versus a caption.

- **Tiny click targets:** Even at 250% zoom, some of the "Learn More" links and small text links were hard for me to click accurately with my tremor. I'd miss and have to try again multiple times.

- **Light gray text disappears:** Any text that wasn't pure black became VERY hard to read, even zoomed in. My eyes are not great, and light gray on white is nearly impossible for me. I skipped entire paragraphs because I simply couldn't read them.

- **Images lose context:** At high zoom, I only see a portion of an image at a time. The case study screenshots and decorative images made no sense to me because I couldn't see the whole picture. Just confusing fragments.

### 2. Trust Concerns

**Multiple Things Made Me Worry This Might Not Be Safe:**

- **Too much technical jargon:** In my experience, when someone uses a lot of complicated words you don't understand, they're either trying to sound smart or they're trying to hide something. Scammers do this. I couldn't tell if this company was legitimate or just using fancy language to confuse people.

- **No clear explanation of services:** Even after reading the whole site, I couldn't articulate what they actually DO. That made me suspicious. Legitimate businesses should be able to explain their services clearly.

- **Form before contact info:** The contact page immediately asked me to "complete the form below" before showing me a phone number or email. That felt like a trick - like they were trying to get my information before I could contact them safely.

- **Download requests:** There were mentions of downloading guides. I'm very wary of downloading anything online. My daughter warned me that's how you get viruses.

- **Lots of acronyms and abbreviations:** ROI, UAT, UI/UX, CSAT - these random letters made me feel like I was missing something important. Maybe there's hidden meaning? Maybe these are codes? It made me distrustful.

- **No photos of real people:** I didn't see any photos of the actual people who work at this company. I like to see who I'm dealing with. Not seeing faces made it feel impersonal and less trustworthy.

- **Chicago phone number:** The (312) area code is Chicago, which is good - that's a real US city. If it had been some weird international number, I would have been more worried. This was actually one of the few things that made me feel more trusting.

- **Big name clients:** Seeing Harvard, Northwestern, and hospitals listed did make me feel somewhat better. But I also thought "how do I know they really work with them? Anyone can put a logo on a website."

### 3. Interaction Difficulties

**My Physical Limitations Made This Site Very Hard to Use:**

- **Shaky hand clicking:** I have a mild tremor, especially when I'm stressed or tired. Small buttons and links were very difficult for me to click. I would hover my mouse over a "Learn More" button, try to click, miss, accidentally click something else, get confused, and have to start over. Very frustrating.

- **Scrolling control:** With my tremor, controlling smooth scrolling is hard. I'd try to scroll down a little bit and it would jump too far. Or I'd accidentally scroll sideways. At 250% zoom with content going in all directions, this was a nightmare.

- **Can't track my location:** Between the zoom, the scrolling, and my vision issues, I constantly lost track of where I was on the page. "Wait, am I in the services section or the problems section? Did I already read this or is this new?"

- **Multiple "Learn More" buttons:** There were SO MANY "Learn More" links that all looked the same. When I'd click one, a new page would load, and I'd forget which service I had clicked on. Were they all different pages or the same? I couldn't tell.

- **Form fields would be impossible:** Although I didn't actually try to fill out the contact form (too scary), I know from experience that typing in form fields with my tremor is very difficult. I make typos, I click in the wrong field, I accidentally submit before I'm ready. Forms give me anxiety.

- **No way to easily get back:** If I clicked on something by accident (which I did several times), I wasn't confident I could get back to where I was. The back button sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Made me afraid to click anything.

- **Links too close together:** In some sections, multiple links were right next to each other. With my shaky clicking, I'd try to click one and hit the other. Very annoying.

### 4. Confusing Language

**I Felt Like I Needed a Dictionary to Understand This Site:**

Words and phrases I did NOT understand:
- **"AI-Centric"** - What does "centric" mean here?
- **"Agentic AI"** - Not a real word! Made me distrust the site.
- **"Bespoke"** - Is that like custom? Why not just say custom?
- **"Tailored consulting"** - Like a tailor for clothes? How does that apply to computers?
- **"Product development services"** - Are they making physical products or computer things?
- **"Harness the power of AI"** - This sounds like marketing nonsense.
- **"High-impact digital products"** - What makes something "high-impact"?
- **"Modernize operations"** - What operations?
- **"Unlock growth"** - Unlock? Like with a key?
- **"Autonomous digital workforce"** - Are these robots? AI workers?
- **"Cross-functional teams"** - What does this mean?
- **"Agile"** - I know this means moving quickly, but in business?
- **"Scalable solutions"** - Scalable like climbing a scale?
- **"ROI"** - These letters mean nothing to me.
- **"UI/UX"** - More meaningless letters.
- **"CSAT"** - What is this??
- **"UAT validation"** - Completely lost.
- **"Bi-weekly sprint releases"** - Sprinting? Releasing what?
- **"Deploy"** - Like deploying troops? For a website?
- **"Seamless handoff"** - Handing off what?
- **"Digital transformation initiatives"** - Transformation? This sounds like science fiction.
- **"Proof of concept"** - Proof of what concept?

Sentences that were too complicated:
- "LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services, from strategy to execution, building high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."
  - This sentence has about five different concepts strung together. By the time I got to the end, I'd forgotten the beginning.

- "We combine deep expertise in product design and development with cutting-edge AI consulting to solve critical business challenges."
  - Too many big words. What does this actually MEAN?

- "Align on scope, priorities, including outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept."
  - This is a list of abstract business terms. I don't understand any of it.

### 5. Where I Almost Gave Up

**I Came Very Close to Closing the Browser Multiple Times:**

1. **Right at the beginning:** When I saw "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development" in the page title, I almost gave up. That's an overwhelming amount of technical language right off the bat. I thought "this isn't for me."

2. **When I saw six different services:** Six! That's too many choices. I felt paralyzed. Which one applies to me? What if I click the wrong one? I don't understand the differences between them. I almost closed the tab.

3. **When I encountered "Agentic AI":** This fake-sounding word made me think the whole site might be a scam. Scammers make up words to sound technical. I seriously considered this might not be legitimate.

4. **When the layout broke at 250% zoom:** I had to scroll horizontally to read content, and text was cutting off. I thought "this website isn't meant for people like me" and almost gave up. If I can't even READ the content, what's the point?

5. **When I saw "Complete the form below":** The contact page asking me to fill out a form immediately was the closest I came to quitting. I thought "they just want my information so they can spam me or scam me." I was ready to close the browser.

6. **Multiple "Learn More" loops:** I clicked on a "Learn More" link, read a page that was still confusing, saw ANOTHER "Learn More" link, felt like I was going in circles. I thought "I'm never going to understand this" and almost quit.

7. **When I read "Download Our Guide":** Download? No thank you! That sounds like a virus waiting to happen. I don't download things from websites I don't fully trust.

**What Kept Me Going:**

- Seeing Harvard, Northwestern, and hospital logos made me think maybe this is real
- I really wanted to find a phone number so I could call instead of using the website
- Stubbornness - I was determined to figure out what they do
- My grandson needs help with something computer-related and I thought maybe this company could help, so I pushed through

### 6. What Would Make Me Feel Confident Continuing

**If This Website Had These Changes, I Would Trust It and Use It:**

✅ **Put the phone number at the very top of every page**

- Let me know I can call a real person anytime

✅ **A simple, ONE SENTENCE explanation at the top**
- "We build custom websites and computer programs for businesses"
- That's it. Clear. Simple. I'd understand immediately.

✅ **Bigger buttons that are easier to click**
- At least 44 pixels tall (I've heard that's the accessible size)
- More space between clickable things
- Maybe even say "Large buttons for easy clicking"

✅ **Dark text on white background - no gray text**
- Every word should be pure black or very dark gray
- No fancy shading or light colors
- I need strong contrast to read

✅ **Test at high zoom levels**
- Make sure the site works at 200% and 300% zoom

✅ **Trust indicators early and obvious**
- "Based in Chicago since 2012"
- "We will never sell your information"

✅ **NO FORMS unless absolutely necessary**
- Just give me a phone number and email
- If you must have a form, make it optional
- Explain exactly what information you need and why
- Promise you won't spam me

✅ **Fewer choices**
- Instead of 6 services, maybe 2-3 main categories
- "Computer help for businesses" and "Website building"
- Don't overwhelm me with options

✅ **A video explanation**
- Someone speaking to the camera in plain English
- "Hi, I'm John from LaunchPad Lab. Here's what we do..."
- I can watch and listen, which is easier than reading

✅ **Progressive disclosure**
- Show me the basics first
- Let me click "Tell me more" if I want details
- Don't dump everything on me at once

✅ **Reassurance about safety**
- "We never ask for credit card information on our website"
- "Your privacy is protected"
- "You can browse safely"

✅ **Better navigation**

✅ **Less scrolling**
- Shorter pages
- More information split across simple pages
- Or collapsible sections I can expand if interested

## Final Thoughts

I'm exhausted. That took so much effort.

I did eventually figure out that LaunchPad Lab does computer and website work for businesses, and I found a phone number I can call. So technically, I succeeded in my task.

But it felt like climbing a mountain. The website seemed designed for young, tech-savvy business professionals - not for someone like me with low vision, shaky hands, and limited computer experience.

Every step was a struggle:
- Couldn't read the light gray text
- Couldn't understand the technical jargon
- Couldn't click on small buttons accurately
- Couldn't navigate the broken layout at high zoom
- Couldn't trust the site until I'd struggled through the whole thing
- Almost gave up multiple times

If I hadn't been determined to find that phone number, I would have left after 2 minutes.

The irony is that this company seems to build websites and technology for other businesses. Shouldn't they know how to make their OWN website accessible and user-friendly?

**My rating: 2/10 for stressed users with accessibility needs**

I completed my task, but barely. And I won't be using this website again - I'll just call them directly if I ever need to.

Please, LaunchPad Lab: make your site work for everyone, not just tech experts. Some of us really struggle, and we deserve to access your services too.

---

**P.S.** - I'm going to call my grandson and ask him to look at this website and explain it to me. That shouldn't be necessary. But right now, it is.
