## My Experience Browsing LaunchPad Lab's Website

Oh boy, this was harder than it should have been! I really wanted to understand what this company does, but I had to squint at my screen the entire time. Let me tell you what happened...

### Landing on the Homepage

When I first opened the site, I was immediately hit with this big hero section. The headline "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." was in large text, which was good! But then underneath it, there was all this smaller text explaining what they do. I had to lean in close to my monitor to read it. The text looked kind of light gray against the background, and it just blended together.

I saw a button that said "Connect with an Expert" which was helpful - at least that was bold enough to see!

### Trying to Figure Out What They Do

There were all these logos scrolling by - Harvard, Northwestern, some company called Prosci. I could barely make out what the logos said because they were kind of washed out looking. I guess they're trying to show off their clients? Would be nice if the names were written out clearly too.

Then I scrolled down and there was a section about being an "AI Partner" or something. The body text was SO SMALL. I could barely read it without zooming my entire browser to 150%. Why do websites make text so tiny? My eyes were getting tired already.

### The Services Section

This part was really confusing visually. There were these cards with icons and text, but the icons were white on a colored background, and some of the text was white too. The contrast was really poor - I couldn't tell where one service ended and another began. 

I think they offer:
- Something about AI automation (there was a robot icon?)
- Web development
- Mobile apps
- Salesforce work
- Design services
- Support services

But honestly, it was hard to parse all of that. The cards were packed together and the text inside was thin and small.

### Looking for Contact Information

This took me FOREVER to find! I scrolled all the way to the bottom of the homepage and there was a tiny line that said "Reach Out" with a black rocket icon. The text was dark gray on a light gray background - I almost missed it completely.

I finally clicked through to a Contact page, and THANK GOODNESS the contact information was clearer there:
- Email: contact@launchpadlab.com
- Phone: (312) 888-9651
- They also mentioned LinkedIn

But again, the body text on that page was unnecessarily small. The icons next to the contact methods were cute, but I would have preferred just bigger, bolder text.

### Case Studies Section

There was a section showing their work with companies like Prosci and CDK Global. The numbers and statistics were in different sizes - some large, some tiny. It felt chaotic. I couldn't follow the visual flow because nothing had enough contrast or size consistency to guide my eye.

## What This Company Does (In My Own Words)

From what I could gather by straining my eyes, LaunchPad Lab is a technology consulting company. They help businesses build custom software and apps. They seem really focused on AI these days - that came through loud and clear because they mentioned AI everywhere.

Specifically, they seem to:
- Build custom web and mobile applications
- Help companies use AI to automate things and save money
- Work with Salesforce (which I know is that business software)
- Design digital products from scratch
- Provide ongoing support after building something

They work with big names like Harvard and Northwestern, so they must be pretty established. They've been around since 2012 according to one section I barely made out.

## How to Contact Them

**Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
**Phone:** (312) 888-9651  
**LinkedIn:** They have a company page you can connect with  
**Contact Form:** There's a form on their contact page where you can fill out your project details

The contact page wasn't too bad - at least the essential information was there once I found it.

## My Summary: What Made This Difficult

### 1. Hard-to-Read Text

- **Body text was WAY too small** throughout the entire site. I'd guess it was 14px or smaller. At my age, I need at least 16-18px to read comfortably.
- **Thin fonts everywhere** - the font weight looked like 300 or 400, which is really hard to read. Bolder text (500-600 weight) would have been much easier on my eyes.
- Several paragraphs of description text that I just gave up reading because they were too small and light.

### 2. Low Contrast Areas

- **Light gray text on white or light backgrounds** - this was the biggest problem. I could barely distinguish the text from the background.
- The service cards had white text on colored backgrounds, but some of those colors were too light.
- The footer area with the "Reach Out" section had very poor contrast - dark gray on light gray.
- Client logos were faded or light colored, making them hard to identify.

### 3. Confusing Visual Hierarchy

- Too much information crammed into sections without clear separation.
- The services cards all looked the same size and weight - no clear priority or focus.
- Numbers and statistics were scattered with inconsistent sizing.
- I couldn't tell what was most important on the page because everything felt equally de-emphasized.

### 4. What Would Improve Clarity

- **Increase base font size to at least 16-18px** for all body text
- **Use higher contrast** - dark text on light backgrounds (not gray on gray!)
- **Bolder font weights** (at least 500-600) for better readability
- **More white space** between sections so things don't feel so cramped
- **Larger, clearer icons** with text labels (not icon-only buttons)
- **Better visual hierarchy** - make important things bigger and bolder
- Add text labels next to or below logo images so I know who the clients are
- Make the contact information more prominent - don't hide it at the bottom in low contrast text

**Overall:** I eventually figured out what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them, but it took a lot of effort and eye strain. For someone like me with vision challenges, this site felt exhausting to navigate. A few simple changes to text size, contrast, and spacing would make this so much more accessible and pleasant to use.
