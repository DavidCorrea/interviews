# AI-25: Publish Detailed Case Studies with Client Names and Outcomes

## User Story

As a **prospective client or stakeholder**, I want **3–5 detailed case studies with client names, deliverables, timeline, and quantified outcomes**, so that **I can evaluate LaunchPad Lab's work and trust in their ability to deliver measurable results**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 3 case studies published
- [ ] Each case study includes: client name, project type, problem description, solution, deliverables, timeline
- [ ] Each case study includes at least one quantified outcome (e.g., "increased conversions by 23%")
- [ ] Case studies are linked from client logos on homepage
- [ ] Case studies are linked from Work page
- [ ] Consistent layout across all case studies

## How to Test

1. Visit **Work** or **Case Studies** section
2. Confirm at least **3 case studies** are available
3. For each case study, verify presence of:
   - Client name
   - Project type / industry
   - Problem description
   - Solution
   - Deliverables
   - Timeline
   - At least one quantified outcome (e.g., "increased conversions by 23%", "reduced load time by 40%")
4. From **homepage** → click a client logo → confirm it links to the corresponding case study
5. From **Work** page → confirm case studies are accessible and use consistent layout

## Developer Notes
