## First Impressions (Language Barriers)

When I opened the website, the first thing I saw was the headline: **"AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development."** I had to stop. "AI" I know—artificial intelligence. But "centric"? I thought maybe it means "focused on" or "about." I'm not sure. And "digital product design"—are they designing products you buy online? Or making apps? Or websites? In Portuguese we would say "design de produtos digitais" but I'm still not 100% sure what that means in practice.

The page looked professional. Clean. But from the beginning I felt like I was reading something written for people who already know this business. Not for someone like me who is evaluating agencies and needs to understand quickly.

> "I can read English, but not like a native speaker. When I see words like 'centric' or 'digital product,' I have to stop and think—or look them up."

## Confusion with Jargon, Idioms, and Complex Sentences

I found many words and phrases that made me confused. I will list them:

**Words I had to look up or guess:**
- **"Bespoke"** — I saw this in a search result about their AI services. I had no idea. I think it might mean "custom" or "made for you"? I'm not sure.
- **"Agentic"** — This word does not exist in my vocabulary. Is it like "agent"? Or "automatic"? I would need to use Google Translate.
- **"Harness the power"** — "Harness" is for horses, no? Why are they talking about horses and AI? I understand now it means "use" but the first time I saw it, I was very confused.
- **"Seamless handoff"** — What is "seamless"? And "handoff"? I know "hand" and "off" but together? Maybe "smooth transfer"? I'm guessing.
- **"Discovery process"** — Discovery means finding something. But "process"? I don't understand how this connects to a website project.
- **"Operational efficiency"** — Too many long words. "Operational" and "efficiency" — I know them separately but together with "drive" or "unlock"? It's too abstract.
- **"Proof of concept"** — I've heard this in meetings. I think it means "test" or "demo"? Not explained on the site.
- **"ROI"** — Three letters. I know it's business. Return on Investment? I think so. But they never spelled it out. I had to guess.
- **"MVP"** — In sports, MVP is "most valuable player." In business? I think it means something else. "Minimum viable product"? I'm not sure. They didn't explain.
- **"UAT validation"** — I don't know what UAT means. User acceptance testing? I'm guessing. Not explained.

**Sentences that were too long or complex:**
- One testimonial said: *"Their attention to detail in the discovery process, and their selective choice of questioning is what really stood out to me. The information they were able to gather from each business unit provided insights that have evolved beyond just our website and have moved on to shaping many aspects of our overall marketing strategy."* — I had to read this three times. "Selective choice of questioning"? "Business unit"? "Evolved beyond"? "Shaping many aspects"? Too many ideas in one sentence. I lost the thread.

- Another: *"They continue to prove that they're a mainstay in our company's growth. Beyond the high-quality product they developed, their communication and ever-ready presence is a sign of security and assurance through what could otherwise become a tumultuous journey of entrepreneurship."* — "Mainstay"? "Ever-ready presence"? "Tumultuous journey of entrepreneurship"? I don't use these words. I had to look up "tumultuous." It means chaotic or difficult. Why not just say "difficult" or "challenging"?

**Idioms or figurative language I didn't understand:**
- "Harness the power" — already mentioned
- "Move the needle" — I saw this in similar agency sites. What needle? I don't get it.
- "Hit the ground running" — Hit the ground? Running? I think it means "start fast" but it's not obvious.
- "Low-hanging fruit" — Fruit on a tree? I think it means "easy things" but why fruit?

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

I looked at the menu. Good—I saw "About," "Services," "Work," "Contact." I know these words. I clicked **About** first.

The page title said "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Okay, so they are a "firm" (company) in Chicago. Good. But the content used more difficult words. I saw "AI-focused," "digital product development," "strategic partner," "digital transformation." I couldn't find one simple sentence that said: "We build websites and apps for businesses."

I clicked **Services**. The title said "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." Again, "AI-focused." I saw things like:
- "AI Automation & Agentic AI" — I don't know what "agentic" means
- "Web and Mobile Application Development" — This one I understood! They make apps.
- "Salesforce Development" — I know Salesforce is a software. So they work with it.
- "Digital Product Strategy & Design" — "Strategy" is okay. "Design" is okay. But together? I'm not sure.

I also looked at **Work**. It said "Our Portfolio of Web & Mobile Software." "Portfolio" — I know this from art. A collection of work. So they have examples of websites and apps they built. That helped me understand. They make websites and mobile apps.

So I put it together: *They build websites and apps, maybe with AI, and they work with Salesforce.* But I had to figure that out myself. Nobody said it simply.

> "I prefer when companies say things simply: 'We make websites and apps. We help you use AI. Here is our phone number.'"

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

I clicked **Contact**. The page said "Contact Us" at the top. Good.

But then I saw many long quotes from clients. Testimonials. In English that was difficult for me. I was looking for a phone number or email. I had to scroll. And scroll. The quotes talked about "discovery process," "selective choice of questioning," "marketing strategy," "tumultuous journey of entrepreneurship." I didn't need to read that. I needed contact information.

I kept scrolling. I was looking for:
- Phone number
- Email address
- Maybe a form to send a message

I'm not sure where the contact form was. Or if the phone and email were visible. On many agency sites, they hide this. They want you to fill a form. But sometimes I prefer to call. Or send an email directly. I need to see the options clearly.

> "I was trying to find a phone number or email, and I had to scroll past all these quotes. Why are the quotes first? I came to contact them, not to read reviews."

## Pain Points Related to Language

1. **Too many words I don't know.** "Bespoke," "agentic," "harness," "seamless," "mainstay," "tumultuous," "entrepreneurship." I would need a dictionary or Google Translate for almost every section.

2. **Idioms that don't translate.** "Harness the power," "move the needle," "hit the ground running." When I put these in Google Translate to Portuguese, they come out strange. The meaning is lost. I need literal, direct language.

3. **Acronyms without explanation.** ROI, MVP, UAT, AI (sometimes). If you use an acronym, spell it out first: "ROI (Return on Investment)." I need that.

4. **Long sentences with many clauses.** The testimonials were the worst. One idea per sentence, please. Short sentences. Active voice. "We do X. We help with Y. Contact us here."

5. **Abstract instead of concrete.** "We drive operational efficiency and unlock growth." What does that mean in practice? I prefer: "We help you work faster and save money." Concrete. Simple.

6. **Inconsistent labels.** If one page says "Contact" and another says "Get in Touch" or "Reach Out," I get confused. Use the same word everywhere. "Contact" is good. Stick with it.

7. **Testimonials on the Contact page.** I came to find how to reach them. The testimonials use difficult language and take up space. Put them somewhere else. Or make them shorter and simpler.

## What Worked Well (Visual Cues, Simple Labels)

1. **Standard menu words.** "About," "Services," "Contact," "Work." I know these. No confusion.

2. **"Contact Us" as the page title.** Clear. I knew I was in the right place.

3. **"Chicago" in the About title.** I knew they are in the United States, in Chicago. Useful for me in Brazil—I know the time zone, the region.

4. **Bullet points when they appeared.** Lists are easier than paragraphs. I can scan. One idea per line. When I saw "Web and Mobile Application Development" as a bullet, I understood quickly.

5. **"Portfolio" with examples.** Even though "portfolio" required a moment of thought, the word plus the idea of "examples of work" helped. Visual context—seeing that they build apps—reinforced the meaning.

6. **Page structure with headings.** When headings were clear (like "Services" or "Contact Us"), I could navigate. I didn't have to read every word. Headings gave me a map.

> "I like headings and lists. I like when they explain acronyms. I don't like when they assume I know American business slang."

## Overall Rating

**2 out of 5**

I was able to understand, after some effort, that LaunchPad Lab builds websites and mobile apps, works with AI and Salesforce, and is based in Chicago. I found the Contact page. But the language was a barrier. Too many words I didn't know. Too many idioms. Too many long sentences. The testimonials on the Contact page made it harder to find what I needed. If I were evaluating agencies for a real project, I might give up on this site and look for one that uses simpler English. Or I would ask a colleague who speaks better English to help me. The site feels written for native speakers and people who already know the industry.
