## First Impressions (Contrast Issues Noticed)

When I first landed on the homepage, I could see the big headline: "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." That was readable—dark enough against the background. But as soon as I scrolled down, I hit a wall. The body text. It was that light gray. You know the one. The kind that looks "elegant" to designers but to me might as well be invisible.

> "I've learned to look for headings and bold text—those usually have enough contrast. But body paragraphs, captions, and secondary text? I often skip them."

I had to squint. I leaned closer to the screen. The text describing their services—something about AI automation, web apps, mobile apps—it all blended into the white. I could make out shapes of words, but reading it fluently? No. My eyes were working overtime before I'd even gotten past the first section.

The overall look was clean and minimalist. Which, in my experience, almost always means low contrast. Soft palettes. Light gray everywhere. I felt that familiar dread: *This is going to be a struggle.*

## Elements That Were Hard to See or Distinguish

**Body text and descriptions:** The paragraphs explaining what they do—their process, their approach—were in a light gray. I couldn't tell you the exact hex code, but it was that #666 or #777 range. On white. For me, that's washed out. I had to re-read sentences two or three times, and even then I wasn't sure I'd caught everything.

**Links:** I couldn't tell what was a link and what wasn't. The navigation had "Work," "Services," "About," "Contact"—but were those underlined? Did they have a different color? I couldn't perceive it. I had to hover over everything and guess, or just click and see what happened. Same with "Learn More" or "Connect with an Expert" buttons. If the hover state was a subtle color shift, I missed it entirely.

> "I also can't tell when I'm hovering over a link unless it's underlined or changes dramatically. Subtle hover effects might as well not exist."

**Testimonials:** The Contact page was full of client quotes. Long ones. And they were in that same light gray—or maybe even lighter. Italicized text on a light background? I gave up. I skimmed the first few words of each quote and moved on. I have no idea what those testimonials said.

**Form labels and placeholders:** When I finally found the contact form, the labels were faint. Placeholder text in the input fields? Even worse. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to type in a field or if it was already filled. Light gray on light gray. My ophthalmologist has told me my retinal cones respond less sharply to luminance differences—and this is exactly what that means. I can't distinguish it.

**Borders and dividers:** Cards, boxes, form fields—if they used very light gray borders (#E0E0E0 or similar), I couldn't see where one section ended and another began. The page felt like a blur of similar shades.

**Icons:** Any icons in the service cards or navigation—if they were pastel or light gray—blended into the background. I couldn't tell what they represented.

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

I went straight for the navigation. I could see there were links—I assumed they were links—labeled "Work," "Services," "About," "Contact." I couldn't distinguish them from regular text by color alone, but the structure was familiar. I clicked **About** first.

The About page title was readable: "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Good. They're a firm in Chicago. But the body content? Same problem. Long paragraphs in light gray. I scanned for headings. I found a few—those were darker, so I could read them. From the headings I gathered they do digital product work, they've been around since 2012, they work with a lot of companies. But the details—the "how" and "why"—were lost to me. I skipped them.

I clicked **Services** next. The page title said "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." I saw section headings for things like web apps, mobile apps, Salesforce, AI automation. The headings helped. But the descriptions under each? Light gray. I couldn't read them. I got the gist from the headings alone: they build web and mobile apps, do Salesforce work, something with AI. That was enough.

I also looked at **Work**. "Our Portfolio of Web & Mobile Software." So they make websites and mobile apps. I pieced it together. But I had to work for it. I relied entirely on headings and bold text. Everything else was a guess.

> "If a site uses light gray everywhere, I'll leave. I don't have time to strain my eyes."

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

I clicked **Contact** in the nav. The page loaded. The first thing I saw was testimonials. Long quote blocks. I scrolled. More testimonials. I kept scrolling, looking for a form, a phone number, an email. The testimonials were in that faint gray—I couldn't read them anyway. They were just blocks of gray blur.

I finally found the contact form. But the labels were light. The input borders were subtle. I wasn't sure where to click. I tabbed through the fields—could I see the focus indicator? Barely. If there was a thin outline or a slight color change, I missed it. I need a 2px outline in black or dark blue. Something I can actually see.

Did I find a phone number? An email? I'm not sure. If they were there, they might have been in small text or light gray. I was looking for "Connect with an Expert" or a form—that seemed to be the main call-to-action. But for someone like me, a visible phone number in big, dark text would be a lifeline. I didn't see one prominently. Or if I did, it didn't register.

## Pain Points Related to Contrast

1. **Body text unreadable without strain.** Light gray (#666 or lighter) on white is not readable for me. I squint, lean in, re-read. After a few paragraphs, I get eye fatigue and skip the rest.

2. **Links indistinguishable from body text.** I cannot identify links by color alone. I need underlines, bold, or a dramatic color change. Without that, I'm guessing.

3. **Hover states invisible.** If links or buttons change subtly on hover—a slight lightness shift, a faint underline—I don't see it. I need bold, background color, or thick underline.

4. **Testimonials wasted on me.** Long quote blocks in light gray? I skip them entirely. They might as well not be there.

5. **Form labels and placeholders too faint.** I need dark labels. Dark placeholder text. Dark borders on inputs. Otherwise I'm not sure what I'm filling out.

6. **Focus indicators inadequate.** When I tab through the form, I need to see clearly where I am. A subtle outline doesn't cut it.

7. **No clear visual boundaries.** Light borders between sections? I can't see them. The page feels like one undifferentiated mass.

## What Worked Well

1. **Headlines and headings.** The main headlines—"AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development," "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago"—were dark enough. I could read those. They gave me an anchor.

2. **Navigation structure.** The nav had standard labels: Work, Services, About, Contact. I knew where to go. I didn't need to read fine print to find the main sections.

3. **Page titles.** Each page had a clear title at the top. That helped me know where I was.

4. **Primary buttons.** If "Connect with an Expert" or similar CTAs used a darker background or stronger color, they stood out. I could identify them as buttons.

5. **Logical flow.** The site structure made sense. About tells you what they do, Services gives details, Contact is for reaching out. I could complete the task despite the contrast issues—but only by relying on the high-contrast elements and skipping the rest.

## Overall Experience Rating

**2 out of 5**

I found what they do (digital product development, web and mobile apps, AI, Salesforce) and I found the Contact page. But I did it by ignoring most of the content. I read headings. I skipped body text. I couldn't read the testimonials. I'm not confident I found the phone number or email. The site felt designed for people with typical contrast perception. For me, it was exhausting. I had to work too hard for basic information. If I had a choice between this site and a competitor with stronger contrast, I'd pick the competitor.

> "I don't have time to strain my eyes. I need strong contrast—black or dark gray on white. That's readable. Everything else is a compromise I shouldn't have to make."
