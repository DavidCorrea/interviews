## First Impressions (Motion/Animation Noticed)

The moment the page loaded, I felt it. The hero section—something about "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development"—didn't just appear. It faded in or slid in. My stomach flipped immediately. I have `prefers-reduced-motion` turned on in my system. I expected the site to honor it. It didn't.

Within seconds I noticed more: service cards fading in as I scrolled, boxes lifting when I hovered, numbers that might have been counting up. The whole page felt like it was in motion. I had to grip my desk. The room tilted. I knew I had to get through this quickly or close the tab.

## Physical Reactions to Motion

- **Dizziness:** Started within 5–10 seconds of load. Got worse as I scrolled. That swimmy, off-balance feeling—like being on a boat.
- **Nausea:** By the time I reached the service cards section, I had that throat-tightening sensation. I had to look away from the screen.
- **Disorientation:** Couldn't tell if the logos were moving or if I was. My vestibular system was confused. Spatial awareness went fuzzy.
- **Headache:** Sharp pain behind my left eye when I accidentally hovered over a logo that bounced or zoomed.
- **Lasting effects:** Even after closing the tab, the dizziness lingered. I had to rest for several minutes before trying again.

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

I couldn't read the homepage normally. Every scroll triggered more fade-ins and slide-ins. I tried scrolling slowly, pausing between sections—but the staggered animations kept firing. Each service card appeared one after another, like dominoes. It made me more nauseous.

I looked for a menu. I found links: Work, Services, About, Contact. I clicked **About** first. The page had similar scroll-triggered effects. I caught phrases like "digital product firm" and "Chicago" but had to skim. I couldn't focus on long paragraphs with things constantly animating into view.

I tried **Services**. Same problem. I saw mentions of AI automation, web apps, mobile apps, Salesforce—but I was fighting dizziness the whole time. I never got a clear, simple sentence like "We build websites and apps for businesses."

I had to disable JavaScript to actually read. With JS off, the content was static. I could finally understand: they build digital products—web apps, mobile apps, AI solutions, Salesforce implementations. They've been around since 2012, work with big clients like Harvard and Northwestern. But I shouldn't have had to break the site to get that information.

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

With JavaScript enabled, I couldn't get far enough. I was too dizzy. I closed the tab.

On my second attempt, I disabled JavaScript first. Then I could navigate. I clicked **Contact** in the menu. The contact page loaded. I scrolled past a form and a bunch of testimonials—long quotes from clients. I was looking for a phone number, an email, an address. I found them at the bottom:

- **Phone:** (312) 888-9651  
- **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com  
- **Address:** 448 N La Salle Dr Floor 9, Chicago, IL 60654

There were also links to LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram. But I had to scroll through testimonials to get there. And I only found this because I disabled JavaScript. With the default experience, I would have closed the tab before ever reaching the contact page.

## Pain Points Related to Motion

1. **`prefers-reduced-motion` ignored.** I have it enabled. The site didn't change. Animations kept running. This feels dismissive—like my needs don't matter.

2. **Scroll-triggered animations everywhere.** Almost every section fades or slides in. As I scroll, content constantly animates. It's continuous motion. I can't escape it.

3. **Hover effects on cards and buttons.** When my cursor passed over a service card, it lifted or transformed. I didn't intend to hover—it happened while trying to read or click. Each accidental hover triggered more discomfort.

4. **No pause/stop controls.** If there are carousels or auto-advancing content, I didn't see pause buttons. I couldn't stop the motion. I had to leave.

5. **Staggered animations.** Elements don't animate all at once—they fire in sequence. That wave effect is especially nauseating. The motion never stops.

6. **Possible counting animations.** The statistics (12+ Years, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients) might count up from zero. Rapid number changes are a trigger. I couldn't look at that section.

7. **Layout shifts.** Images loading after the page rendered caused content to jump. Unexpected movement is disorienting.

8. **No way to opt out.** No "Reduce motion" toggle. No way to turn off animations without disabling JavaScript—which breaks other things.

## What Worked Well (Static Content)

1. **With JavaScript disabled, the site was usable.** All content was static. No fade-ins, no hover effects, no carousels. I could read and navigate without physical distress.

2. **Standard navigation labels.** "About," "Services," "Contact," "Work"—I knew what those meant. The menu structure was logical.

3. **Contact information exists.** Phone, email, and address are on the site. I found them once I could actually browse.

4. **Page titles were clear.** "Contact Us," "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago"—helped me know where I was.

5. **No auto-playing video.** I didn't encounter video that autoplayed. That would have been worse.

## Overall Rating

**2 out of 5**

I was able to complete the task—find what they do and how to contact them—but only by disabling JavaScript. With the default experience, the site is unusable for me. The motion triggered dizziness, nausea, and headache within seconds. The fact that `prefers-reduced-motion` is ignored is a critical failure. A company that builds digital products should understand that their own website excludes users with vestibular disorders. I would not recommend this site to anyone with motion sensitivity. I'd tell them to call the number directly or ask someone else to look it up.
