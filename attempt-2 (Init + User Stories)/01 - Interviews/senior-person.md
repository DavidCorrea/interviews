## First Impressions

I opened the site and the first thing I saw was a big headline: "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." Good—at least the main message was large enough to read. But I had to stop and think. "AI-centric" — I've heard that term on the news. I think it means something with computers and artificial intelligence. But "digital product design"? I wasn't sure. Do they design products you buy online? Or do they make websites? I had to read it a few times.

I looked for the menu. Where do you usually find it? At the top. I scanned the top of the page. I saw the logo—LaunchPad Lab. I saw something that looked like three horizontal lines. I didn't know what that was. I thought maybe it was a decoration or a loading indicator. I almost skipped right past it.

> "I'm not stupid—I've used computers for years. But things have changed. Websites used to have menus you could see. Now there's this icon with three lines and I'm supposed to know it opens a menu? I didn't even notice it at first."

I kept looking. Eventually I found the words: Work, Services, About, and something that said "Connect with an Expert." That last one—I wasn't sure what it meant. Connect to what? Connect with whom? I was looking for "Contact." I've seen "Contact" on every website for twenty years. Why not just say "Contact"?

I also noticed the text underneath the headlines. Small. And light. Light gray, I think. I had to lean in. My reading glasses help, but thin fonts and small text still tire me out. I sometimes use the zoom in my browser—Ctrl and the plus key—but I didn't want to do that right away. I wanted to see if the site was readable as-is. It wasn't.

## Confusion with Modern Web Patterns

The three lines—the hamburger menu, I think they call it—I've seen it before on my phone. My daughter showed me. But on a desktop computer, I expect to see the full menu. I don't expect to have to click something to reveal it. When I first loaded the page, I wasn't sure if the menu was hidden or if I was missing something. I scrolled and looked. I finally found it, but it took me a moment.

I also worry about clicking the wrong thing. What if I submit a form by accident? Is there a way to undo? I like it when things are straightforward. Tell me what things are. Don't make me guess.

> "I hesitated before clicking because I didn't know what would happen. I didn't want to break anything."

I'm not familiar with carousels or things that auto-advance. If there were pictures or content that moved on their own, I might have found it distracting. I prefer to read at my own pace. I don't want content to change while I'm still looking at it.

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

I clicked on **About** first. I thought that would tell me what they do. The page said "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Okay, so they're a firm—a company. And they're in Chicago. That's where I'm from, so that's helpful. But the page had a lot of text. Long paragraphs. I skimmed. I got something about digital products, software, AI, web and mobile apps. I think they build websites and phone apps for businesses. But I had to piece that together myself. Nobody just said it simply.

I tried **Services** next. The title said "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." Again, "AI-focused" — I'm still a bit fuzzy on that. I saw things like web apps, mobile apps, Salesforce. I know apps are things on your phone. So they make websites and phone apps. That helped. But the language was still a bit heavy. "Discovery process," "product strategy," "managed services"—I've heard some of these terms but I'm not sure I could explain them.

I also looked at **Work**. It said "Our Portfolio of Web & Mobile Software." "Portfolio" is another word I had to think about. I think it means examples of their work. So they make websites and phone apps. That confirmed it for me.

> "I figured out what they do. But I had to work for it. A simple sentence at the top—'We build websites and apps for businesses'—would have saved me a lot of scrolling."

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

I was looking for "Contact." I saw "Connect with an Expert" in the nav. I wasn't sure if that was the same thing. I clicked it anyway. It took me to a page that said "Contact Us" at the top. Good—so that was the contact page.

But then I hit a wall of testimonials. Long quotes from other people. Paragraph after paragraph. I was looking for a phone number or email. I had to scroll past all of it. At my age, I sometimes prefer to just call. I don't always want to fill out a form. I need to see the phone number and email right there, in big letters, so I can write them down.

I kept scrolling. I finally found the contact details—email and phone. They were there. But they weren't prominent. I would have preferred them right at the top. Phone number and email should be visible without scrolling.

I also saw a form. "Complete the form below." I looked at the fields. I didn't see clear labels above each box—just placeholders that said things like "Name" or "Email." I know that when you start typing, those placeholders disappear. Then what? I can't remember what goes in each box. I need labels that stay visible. I also need to know which fields are required. What if I miss one and the form won't submit? I'd feel foolish.

> "I was afraid I'd submitted the form by accident. I didn't. But I was nervous. I like to see a clear 'Submit' button and I want to know what happens after I click it. Is there a confirmation? Can I go back?"

I didn't fill out the form. I had the email and phone, so I could contact them that way. But if someone had to use the form—especially someone older—I think they'd struggle.

## Pain Points

**Small text and thin fonts.** The body text was too small for me to read comfortably. I'd guess 14px, maybe less. I need at least 16px. And the fonts were thin—that light, wispy style. It strains my eyes. I had to zoom in, and that made it harder to see the whole page at once.

**The hamburger menu.** I didn't notice it at first. I didn't know what the three lines meant. Even when I found it, I hesitated. I prefer traditional layouts: visible navigation bars, clear labels. I don't want to have to click something to reveal the menu.

**"Connect with an Expert" instead of "Contact."** I expected "Contact." That's what I've seen on every website for decades. "Connect with an Expert" sounds like marketing. I wasn't sure it would take me to the contact page.

**Too much scrolling to find contact info.** Testimonials before the form. Contact details buried below. I had to scroll and scroll. I'm not as fast as I used to be. I get tired. Key information should be at the top.

**Placeholder-only labels on forms.** I need labels above or beside the fields. Placeholders that disappear when I type are confusing. I forget what goes where.

**Fear of mistakes.** I worry about clicking the wrong thing. Submitting a form by accident. Breaking the website. I want clear "Back" or "Cancel" options. I want to know that my actions are reversible.

**Unfamiliar patterns.** Carousels, icon-only buttons, swipe gestures—I don't use these. I need things that are obvious. Underlined links. Labeled buttons. Familiar structures.

## What Worked Well

**The main headline.** "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." It was large and readable. I got the core message without straining.

**The menu structure.** Once I found it, the links were clear: Work, Services, About, and the contact link. I knew where to go. The structure was logical.

**"About" and "Services."** Those are familiar words. I've seen them on other websites. I knew what to expect.

**Chicago in the title.** I knew they're local. That's useful for me—my school district is in the area.

**The statistics section.** There was a section with big numbers—12+ Years, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients. Those were large and bold. Readable. That's how content should be presented.

**"Contact Us" on the contact page.** When I got there, the page title said "Contact Us." That confirmed I was in the right place.

**Contact info was reachable.** I found the email and phone. They were links, so I could click them. The information is there—it just wasn't easy to find.

## Overall Rating

**2 out of 5**

I completed the task. I know what LaunchPad Lab does (they build websites and apps for businesses, with a focus on AI and digital products) and I found their contact information (email and phone). But it took me longer than it should have. The small text, the hamburger menu I didn't notice at first, the contact info buried under testimonials, the form labels that might disappear—all of it made the experience harder than it needed to be. I'm not confident I could have filled out the form without help. I'd probably call instead.

> "The content is there. But the design assumes I'm comfortable with modern websites. I'm not. I need bigger text, clearer labels, and contact information I can find without scrolling through a wall of quotes. A few simple changes would make this so much easier for someone like me."

## Summary

Robert Henderson (72, retired school administrator) successfully completed the task of finding what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them. He relied on the main menu (once he found it), the About and Services pages to understand the company, and the Contact page for contact details. Major barriers: small text and thin fonts, unfamiliarity with the hamburger menu, "Connect with an Expert" instead of "Contact," contact info buried below testimonials, and form labels that may rely on placeholders. He prefers visible navigation, clear labels, 16px+ text, and familiar patterns. Improvements to typography, navigation visibility, contact placement, and form design would substantially improve the experience for older adults like Robert.
