## First Impressions: How Colors Appear

When I first landed on the LaunchPad Lab homepage, my immediate reaction was: *"Another tech site that looks green to me."* I know it's probably blue—most corporate and agency sites use blue for trust and professionalism—but with my tritanopia, blues register as greenish or teal. The header, any accent colors, and what I assume are blue CTAs all read as various shades of green. It's not jarring, but it does make the intended "professional blue" aesthetic feel off. The brand identity they're going for doesn't land the same way for me.

Light blue or pale backgrounds can blend into white or light gray for me. If there are subtle gradients in the hero section—blue to lighter blue, or yellow accents—those distinctions are largely lost. I've learned to scan for structure and text rather than rely on color to set the mood.

## Difficulty Distinguishing Elements

**Links vs. body text:** If links are styled only by color (no underline, no bold), I struggle. On the homepage and inner pages, I had to tab through or hover to see which text was clickable. Navigation links in the header—things like "Services," "Work," "About," "Contact"—were not always obvious. I rely on position and labels, but when everything looks the same color, I second-guess myself.

**Primary vs. secondary buttons:** If the main CTA is a filled blue button and secondary options are gray outlines, I see filled green vs. gray. The hierarchy is somewhat preserved by fill vs. outline, which helps. But when both use similar treatments and differ mainly by blue vs. gray, that distinction can blur. I look for size, borders, and text labels to confirm which is the primary action.

**Hover and focus states:** Subtle color shifts—blue to darker blue, or a light yellow highlight—are often invisible to me. I depend on underlines, border changes, or shadows. If the site uses a faint blue focus ring, it may not stand out. Keyboard navigation helped me discover focusable elements when visual cues failed.

## Finding What the Company Does

**Homepage:** The main headline—"AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development"—was clear and text-based. I didn't need color to understand the value proposition. That was a relief. I could answer "what does this company do?" from the headline alone.

**Navigation:** I looked for a Services or About link to dig deeper. The nav structure was logical—Services, Work, About, Industries—so I could find "Services" and "About" by label. I didn't need color-coded sections. The About page confirmed they're a Chicago-based digital product firm, founded in 2012, with AI-focused services. Text and headings did the work.

**Service cards and sections:** If service cards or process steps use colored borders or icons (blue, teal, purple), those colors all run together for me. I relied on icon shapes and text. As long as the content is readable and the hierarchy is clear from headings and layout, I could understand their offerings.

> *"The copy is good. I got that they do AI automation, web and mobile development, and consulting. I didn't need a color-coded diagram to figure that out."*

## Finding Contact Information

**Locating the Contact page:** I looked for "Contact" in the main navigation. It was there, which is standard. I didn't have to hunt through a footer or hidden menu. The link itself—whether blue or green to my eyes—was findable by position and label.

**Contact form:** The contact page had a form with testimonials. I needed to verify: Are required fields indicated only by color? Do error and success states use color alone? I've been burned before by forms where "success" is a green border and "error" is a blue or teal border—I can't tell them apart. I'd want to see icons (✓ for success, ✗ for error) and clear text messages. If the form uses only colored borders or backgrounds for validation, that would be a problem for me.

**Footer links:** Footer links are often the same color as body text, with no underline. I typically use Cmd+F to search for "contact" or "email" when links are hard to spot. Having "Contact" in the main nav made that less necessary.

> *"Contact was easy to find in the nav. The form itself—I'd need to actually submit it to know if validation feedback is accessible. But at least I didn't have to dig for it."*

## Pain Points Related to Color Perception

1. **Blue-dominant design:** The site likely uses blue as the primary brand color. To me, it reads as green. The intended "trust and professionalism" vibe is diluted. It's not broken, but it doesn't feel as polished as it probably does to typical vision users.

2. **Link visibility:** If links are blue (or what I see as green) with no underline, they can blend with black or dark gray text, especially when desaturated. I had to hover or tab to confirm interactivity.

3. **Charts and data visualizations:** If case studies or portfolio pieces use charts with blue, yellow, purple, or cyan segments without labels or patterns, I wouldn't be able to interpret them. I didn't see heavy data viz on the main pages I visited, but it's a risk on work/case study pages.

4. **Hero imagery:** Photos with blue skies, yellow accents, or purple gradients can look washed out or confusing. If critical information lives in those images without alt text or captions, I'd miss it.

5. **Focus indicators:** A subtle blue focus ring may not meet the 3:1 contrast I need. I depend on visible focus states for keyboard navigation.

## What Worked Well (Non-Color Cues)

- **Clear headings and structure:** H1, H2, H3 hierarchy made it easy to scan. I didn't need color to understand the page layout.
- **Descriptive link labels:** "Services," "Work," "About," "Contact" are self-explanatory. I didn't need to distinguish them by color.
- **Text-first value proposition:** The main message was in the headline, not in a color-coded graphic.
- **Logical navigation:** Standard nav pattern—main links in the header, Contact visible. I could find things by position and label.
- **Keyboard navigation:** Tab order and focusable elements helped me discover links when visual cues were weak.

> *"The site isn't terrible for me. The structure is solid. But it's clearly built for people who see blue. I had to work around the color choices."*

## Overall Experience Rating

**3 out of 5**

I could complete both tasks—understand what the company does and find how to contact them—without major blockers. The content and structure carried me through. But the blue-dominant design meant I was constantly compensating. Links, buttons, and accents that might feel obvious to others required extra attention from me. I'd use this site to evaluate LaunchPad Lab as a vendor, but the experience would be smoother with underlines on links, stronger focus indicators, and non-color differentiation for buttons and form validation.

## Summary Quote

> *"I found what I needed—they do AI-focused digital product design and development, and I can reach them through the Contact page. But the site feels like it was designed for someone else's eyes. A few non-color cues would go a long way."*
