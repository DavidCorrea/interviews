## First Impressions

I opened the site with my browser already zoomed to 150%—that's my default for most websites. The first thing I saw was a big headline: "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." Good—at least the main message was large enough to read without straining.

But then I looked at the text underneath. Small. And light. Light gray on white, or something close to it. I had to lean in. My eyes were already working harder than they should be.

> "I'm not blind—I can see. But small text and thin fonts? Forget it."

The overall look was clean and professional, but clean doesn't mean readable. I could tell right away this was going to be one of those sites where I'd be zooming and squinting the whole time.

## Text Size, Readability, and Contrast

**Font size:** The body text was way too small. I'd guess 14px, maybe less in some places. At my age, I need at least 16px to read comfortably. I had to bump my zoom to 175% just to get through the introductory paragraph, and even then it felt like work.

**Font weight:** Thin fonts everywhere. The weight looked like 300 or 400—that light, wispy style that's popular on agency sites. It strains my eyes. I need bolder text. 500 or 600 weight would make a world of difference.

**Contrast:** This was the biggest problem. Light gray text on white or light gray backgrounds. I could barely distinguish the words from the background. In one section—I think it was the footer or a "Reach Out" area—there was dark gray text on light gray. I almost missed it completely.

> "Why do so many websites use tiny, light gray text? Make it bigger and darker. That's all I ask."

**Line height:** Some paragraphs felt cramped. The lines ran together. I prefer at least 1.5 line height—it helps me track from line to line without losing my place.

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

I looked at the main headline first: "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." Okay, so they do something with AI and digital products. But what does that mean in plain English?

I scrolled down. There were logos—Harvard, Northwestern, some other companies. The logos were faded or light-colored. I could barely make out the names. I guess they're showing off clients, but it would help if the names were written out clearly.

I clicked on **Services** in the navigation. The page title said "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." The service cards had icons and text, but the contrast was poor—white text on colored backgrounds, and some of those colors were too light. I could tell they offer AI automation, web development, mobile apps, Salesforce work, design, and support. But parsing it all took effort. The text inside the cards was thin and small.

I also tried **About**. More of the same—long paragraphs in small, light text. I skimmed. I got the gist: they're a digital product firm in Chicago, they've been around since 2012, they work with big organizations. But I had to work for it.

> "I got there. I always do. But I was tired by the end."

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

I clicked **Contact** in the nav. The page said "Contact Us" at the top. Good.

But then I hit a wall of testimonials. Long quotes from clients. Paragraph after paragraph. I was looking for a phone number or email, and I had to scroll past all of it. At 150% zoom, I see less of the page at once. I scroll more. Scrolling through testimonials felt like a chore.

> "Why put testimonials before the contact form? I'm trying to reach you, not read your reviews."

When I finally found the contact details—email and phone—they were there, but the text around them was still small. The contact info itself was clearer than some of the body text, but it wasn't prominent. I would have preferred it right at the top, in big, bold letters. Phone number and email should be visible without scrolling.

I didn't test the form in detail. Forms make me nervous when the labels are small—I worry about making mistakes. A visible phone number is a lifeline. I can call. I don't have to fill out boxes.

## Pain Points

**Text size and weight:** Body text below 16px is difficult. Thin fonts (300–400 weight) strain my eyes. I had to zoom to 175% in places, and at 200% some layouts started to feel cramped. The sticky header took up more relative space when zoomed—I noticed it eating into my view.

**Low contrast:** Light gray on white is the worst. I sometimes use high contrast mode when I'm near a window and the screen is washed out. I didn't test it on this site, but I worry: if the site uses light gray everywhere, high contrast mode might not fix it, or it might break the styling.

**Scrolling to find contact info:** Too much scrolling. Testimonials before the form. Contact details not at the top. At 150% zoom, I see less. I had to scroll more. Key information should be findable without excessive scrolling.

**Service cards and logos:** Poor contrast in some sections. White text on light backgrounds. Faded client logos. I couldn't tell where one service ended and another began in some areas.

**No skip links:** I didn't see a "Skip to main content" or "Skip to contact form" link. That would have helped me get to the contact section faster without tabbing or scrolling through everything.

## What Worked Well

**Main headline:** Large and readable. I got the core message—AI, digital products, development—without straining.

**Navigation:** The menu had clear labels—Work, Services, About, Contact. I knew where to go. The structure was logical.

**Statistics section:** There was a section with big numbers—12+ Years, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients. Those were large and bold. Readable. That's how content should be presented.

**"Connect with an Expert" button:** Bold enough to see. Good size. I could identify it as a call-to-action.

**Layout reflow:** At 150% zoom, the layout didn't completely break. I didn't get horizontal scrolling at that level. At 200% I'd need to test more—some sites break there.

## Overall Rating

**3 out of 5**

I completed the task. I figured out what they do (AI-focused digital product development, web and mobile apps, Salesforce, strategy) and I found the contact information (email, phone). But it cost me. The small text, thin fonts, and low contrast made everything harder than it needed to be. I had to zoom, scroll, and squint. The contact page buried the important stuff under testimonials.

> "I'd probably still reach out if I needed their services. But I wouldn't enjoy the experience. A few simple changes—bigger text, bolder fonts, better contrast, contact info at the top—would make this so much more accessible."

## Summary

Margaret Chen successfully completed the task of finding what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them. She relied on browser zoom at 150% and navigated via the main menu. The main headline and statistics section were readable, but body text, font weight, and contrast created significant barriers. The contact page's placement of testimonials before contact details required excessive scrolling. Improvements to typography (size, weight, line height), contrast, and the prominence of contact information would substantially improve the experience for users with low vision who rely on browser zoom.
