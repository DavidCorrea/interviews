## First Impressions (Voice Navigability)

I opened the site and said "click Contact." Nothing happened. I tried "click About." Nothing. I realized I needed to orient myself first. I said "scroll down" to see what was on the page. The page moved. Good—at least scroll works.

I said "click LaunchPad Lab" thinking the logo might take me home. I'm not sure if it worked or if I was already on the homepage. The logo might not have visible text—it could be an image. I couldn't tell.

> "When I open a site, I need something I can say. 'Click Contact.' 'Click About.' If there's nothing to say, I'm stuck before I've started."

I looked for the navigation. I saw links: Work, Services, About, Contact. Those are words I can say. I said "click About." It worked. The page loaded. Relief. At least the main nav links have visible labels. That's the bare minimum, but I'll take it.

## Difficulty with Unlabeled Elements

The first real problem: the menu button. On smaller screens—or when the nav collapses—there's usually a hamburger icon. Three horizontal lines. I said "click menu." Nothing. I said "click hamburger." Nothing. I said "click navigation." Nothing. There was no visible text next to that icon. I had to say "show numbers" to get a grid overlay. Then I said "click 3" or whatever number was on the menu button. It worked, but I had to remember which number. That's exhausting.

> "Icon-only buttons are my nightmare. I can't say 'click' plus nothing. There's nothing to say. Show numbers is my fallback, but it's slow and disorienting. I have to map numbers to elements in my head."

Social icons in the footer or header—LinkedIn, maybe Twitter. Same problem. They're just icons. No "LinkedIn" or "Twitter" visible. I said "click LinkedIn." Nothing. I had to use show numbers again. Same with any arrow buttons for carousels or "next" controls. "Click next"? Maybe. "Click arrow"? Unlikely to work. If the button shows only an arrow graphic with no text, I'm stuck.

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

I said "click About." The About page loaded. The headline said "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Okay—they're a firm in Chicago. I said "scroll down" a few times. More text about digital products, AI, web and mobile development. I got the gist: they build websites and apps for businesses.

I went back and said "click Services." The Services page had cards—AI Automation, Web Development, Mobile Development, Salesforce, and so on. Each card had a "Learn more" link. I said "click Learn more." The wrong one activated. There are multiple "Learn more" links on the page. I wanted to learn about AI Automation. I got Web Development instead. I had to go back and try again. I said "click Learn more" again. Wrong one again. I gave up and just read the visible text on the cards. I got enough information without clicking through.

> "When every link says 'Learn more,' saying 'click Learn more' is a gamble. I never know which one I'll get. I need unique labels. 'Learn more about AI Automation'—that's what I'd say. That would work."

The homepage headline—"AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development"—gave me the core message. I understood they do AI-focused digital product work. But getting there required navigating past unlabeled elements and duplicate links.

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

I said "click Contact." It worked. The Contact page loaded. "Contact Us" at the top. Good.

Then I hit a wall. The page was full of testimonials. Long quotes. Paragraph after paragraph. I said "scroll down" repeatedly. I was looking for a phone number, an email, or a contact form. I kept going. Down, down, down.

> "Why put testimonials before the contact form? I'm trying to reach you, not read your reviews. I had to scroll through all of it to find anything useful."

When I finally reached the contact form, I tried to focus the fields by saying their labels. "Click Name." "Click Email." The labels might have been there—I'm not sure. Some forms use placeholder-only fields. You focus the field and the placeholder disappears. Then you don't know what you're dictating into. I need visible, persistent labels. "Name," "Email," "Company," "Message"—I need to see those words so I know what to say.

I found the phone number and email eventually. They were links: contact@launchpadlab.com and (312) 888-9651. I could say "click" plus the email or phone. That worked. But they were buried. I'd have preferred them right at the top. I can dictate an email or use a phone. Forms take longer. More dictation. More chances to mess up.

There was a "Connect" link—I think it goes to LinkedIn. "Connect" by itself is useless. Connect to what? I said "click Connect" and something happened, but I had no idea where I was going. It should say "Connect with LaunchPad Lab on LinkedIn" or "LaunchPad Lab on LinkedIn." Then I'd know.

## Pain Points

**Icon-only buttons:** The hamburger menu, social icons, carousel arrows, close buttons—none of them have visible text. I cannot target them by voice. I have to use "show numbers" every time. That's a failure. Every interactive element should have a visible label.

**Duplicate link text:** Six or more "Learn more" links. Saying "click Learn more" activates a random one. I can't choose. I need unique, descriptive labels. "Learn more about AI Automation." "Learn more about Web Development." Each link should be distinguishable by what I say.

**Unclear labels:** "Connect" for LinkedIn. What does that mean? I need the destination in the label. "Connect with LaunchPad Lab on LinkedIn."

**Contact info buried:** Testimonials before the form. Phone and email somewhere in the middle or bottom. I had to scroll through a lot to get there. Key information should be findable without that much work.

**Placeholder-only or floating labels:** If form fields show only placeholders, or if labels disappear when I focus, I don't know what to dictate. I need visible, persistent labels. "Name," "Email," "Message"—always visible.

**Hover-only interactions:** I didn't run into dropdowns that open only on hover—or if I did, I didn't notice because I was using voice. But if they exist, I can't use them. I cannot hover. All functionality must be available via click. If a menu only opens when you hover, I'm stuck.

**Form accessibility:** The contact form—if it exists and is reachable—needs clear labels. I dictate into fields. I say the label, then dictate the value. If the form is in an iframe or doesn't load properly, I might never find it. I'm not sure I ever successfully focused every field. The experience was confusing.

## What Worked Well (Clearly Labeled Elements)

**Main navigation:** Work, Services, About, Contact. Clear. I could say each word and activate the link. That's the foundation. Without that, I'd be lost.

**"Connect with an Expert" or primary CTA:** If there's a big button that says "Connect with an Expert" or "Contact," I can say that. It's visible. It's unique. Good.

**Contact info as links:** The email and phone were links. I could say "click" plus the email or phone number. That worked. The information was there—just buried.

**Scroll commands:** "Scroll down," "scroll up," "page down"—the page responded. I could reach all the content. No infinite scroll failures that I noticed.

**Page titles:** Each page had a descriptive title. "Contact Us | LaunchPad Lab." "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." When I navigated, I could tell where I was.

## Overall Rating

**2 out of 5**

I completed the task. I figured out what LaunchPad Lab does—they're a digital product firm that builds web and mobile apps, AI solutions, Salesforce work—and I found the contact information. But it cost me. Icon-only buttons forced me to use "show numbers" repeatedly. Duplicate "Learn more" links meant I activated the wrong one. Contact info was buried under testimonials. The "Connect" link was meaningless. If the contact form has placeholder-only or floating labels, I'd struggle to dictate into it.

> "I'd probably still reach out if I needed their services. But I wouldn't enjoy the experience. Add visible labels to every button. Make every link unique. Put contact info at the top. These aren't hard fixes. They're basic accessibility for anyone who can't use a mouse."

## Summary

Jennifer Torres (voice control user with ALS) completed the task of finding what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them, using only voice commands. She navigated by saying "click [label]" for visible links and buttons. Key barriers: icon-only buttons (hamburger menu, social icons, carousel arrows) with no visible labels—requiring "show numbers" fallback; multiple "Learn more" links with identical text, causing wrong link activation; "Connect" link with unclear purpose; contact information buried below testimonials; and potential form labeling issues. Improvements to visible labels on all interactive elements, unique link text, and contact page structure would substantially improve the experience for voice control users.
