## First Impressions

When I first opened the website, I saw a lot going on. The page had big words at the top that said something like "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." I had to stop and read that a few times. I didn't know what "AI-centric" meant. I thought maybe it was a typo or something. And "digital product design" — I wasn't sure if they sell products or make websites or what.

The page felt busy. There were pictures and text moving around. I had to take my time and figure out where to look first. I'm used to websites that have a simple menu at the top with words like "About" and "Contact." I looked for that.

## Confusion with Jargon and Complex Language

A lot of the words on the site were hard for me. Here are some that made me stop and think:

- **"AI-centric"** — I don't really know what AI means in this context. Is it like a robot? A computer thing?
- **"Digital product design"** — Are they designing products you buy online? Or making apps?
- **"Discovery process"** — I saw this in one of the quotes. I thought discovery was like finding something. I didn't get how it related to a website.
- **"Entrepreneurship journey"** — That's a long word. I know "journey" means a trip. But "entrepreneurship" — I had to sound it out. I still don't know what it means.
- **"Tumultuous"** — Another word in a quote. I had no idea.
- **"MVP"** — I've seen this before. I think it might mean something different in business than in sports.

I had to re-read a lot of sentences. Sometimes I'd get to the end of a paragraph and forget what the beginning said. That happens to me a lot. I wish they had a simple sentence at the top of each page that said, in plain words, what the page is about.

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

I looked for a menu. I found one — it had links like "Work," "Services," "About," and "Contact." That was good. I know those words.

I clicked on **About** first. I thought that would tell me what they do. The page said "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Okay, so they're a "firm" — that usually means a company. And they're in Chicago. That's where I live, so that's good. But I still didn't get a clear answer. The page had more text, but it was long and used a lot of those hard words. I got tired after a couple of paragraphs.

I tried **Services** next. The title said "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." Again, "AI-focused" — I'm still confused. I saw things like web apps, mobile apps, maybe something about Salesforce. I know apps are things on your phone. But I couldn't put it all together into one simple sentence like "We build websites and phone apps for businesses."

I also looked at **Work**. It said "Our Portfolio of Web & Mobile Software." "Portfolio" is another word I had to think about. I think it means examples of their work. So they make websites and phone apps. That helped a little. But I had to figure that out myself. Nobody just said it simply.

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

I clicked on **Contact**. The page said "Contact Us" at the top. Good — that's what I was looking for.

But then I saw a bunch of quotes from other people. Long quotes. One of them talked about "the discovery process" and "selective choice of questioning" and "marketing strategy." I didn't understand any of that. I was trying to find a phone number or email, and I had to scroll past all these quotes.

I kept scrolling. I was looking for:
- A phone number
- An email address
- Maybe an address

I'm not sure I ever found them. Or if I did, they might have been mixed in with a form or at the bottom. I get mixed up when there's a form with lots of boxes. I need to see the phone number and email right there, in big letters, so I can write them down or call. Sometimes I'd rather just call than fill out a form. Forms make me nervous — what if I do it wrong?

I'm not sure how many clicks it took to get to the contact page. Maybe two or three? The menu was there, which helped. But once I got there, I felt like the contact info was hiding.

## Pain Points Related to Cognitive Processing

1. **Too many hard words.** I had to stop and think about almost every section. Words like "AI-centric," "discovery process," "entrepreneurship" — I don't use those. I need simple words.

2. **Long paragraphs.** When there's a big block of text, I lose my place. I forget what I read. Short sentences and bullet points work better for me.

3. **The quotes on the Contact page.** Why are there so many quotes from other people? I was trying to find how to contact them. The quotes didn't help me. They just made the page longer and harder to scan.

4. **No simple summary.** I wish the first thing on the homepage said something like: "We build websites and apps for businesses. We're in Chicago. Here's how to contact us." Instead, I had to piece it together from different pages.

5. **I'm not sure about the menu.** Was it a hamburger menu? Did I have to click something to open it? I might have missed it if it was hidden. I need the main links to be obvious.

6. **Forms.** If there's a contact form, I need clear labels. I need to know which boxes are required. I need to know what happens after I click Send. And I need a phone number or email as a backup, in case I don't want to use the form.

## What Worked Well (Simple and Clear Elements)

1. **The word "Contact" in the menu.** I knew what that meant. Standard word. Good.

2. **"About" and "Services."** Those are familiar. I've seen them on other websites.

3. **Chicago in the title.** I knew they're local. That's useful.

4. **The page titles.** Each page had a title at the top (like "Contact Us" or "About Our Digital Product Firm"). That helped me know where I was.

5. **The menu structure.** It seemed like the main links were in a logical order. I didn't have to dig through lots of nested menus.

## Overall Experience Rating

**2 out of 5**

I was able to get a rough idea of what they do (they build websites and apps) and I found the Contact page. But it took me a long time, and I had to work hard to understand the words. I'm not confident I found the phone number or email. If I had to contact them for real, I might ask my support worker or my sister to help me. The site felt like it was written for people who already know the business, not for someone like me who's just trying to find out basic information.
