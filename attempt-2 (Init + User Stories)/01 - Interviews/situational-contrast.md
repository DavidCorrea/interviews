## First Impressions (Environmental Conditions)

I was at a coffee shop near the window—my usual spot when I need to get out of the house. The sun was streaming in, and my laptop screen was already fighting the glare. I pulled up LaunchPad Lab's site. The main headline—"AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development"—I could read that. Dark enough. Good. But as soon as I scrolled down, the body text just… disappeared. It was that light gray. In the sunlight, it might as well have been invisible.

> "I don't have bad eyes—I just don't always have perfect lighting. I tilted my laptop and cupped my hand to block the glare, but the light gray text was still washed out."

I cranked up the brightness. That helped a little, but the service descriptions—whatever they said about AI, web apps, mobile apps—were still a struggle. I could make out the shapes of words, but reading fluently? No. The screen felt like it was fighting me. The design looked clean and minimal. Which, in my experience, almost always means it'll fail the moment you're not in a perfectly lit room with a top-tier display.

## Elements Washed Out by Sunlight / Glare

**Body text and descriptions:** The paragraphs explaining what they do were in light gray. #666, #777—that range. On white. In bright light, that combination just vanishes. I had to squint. I leaned in. I re-read sentences two or three times. After a few paragraphs, I gave up and started scanning for headings instead.

**Links:** I couldn't tell what was a link. The nav had "Work," "Services," "About," "Contact"—but were they underlined? A different color? In the glare, I couldn't tell. I had to hover over everything and guess. Same with "Learn More" or "Connect with an Expert." If the hover state was subtle—a slight color shift, a faint underline—I missed it entirely.

> "Subtle hover effects might as well not exist when you're near a window. I need bold underlines or a dramatic color change. Something that holds up in any light."

**Testimonials:** The Contact page was full of client quotes. Long blocks of italicized text in that same light gray—or lighter. I skimmed the first few words and moved on. In the sunlight, those testimonials were just gray blobs. I have no idea what they said.

**Form labels and placeholders:** When I finally found the contact form, the labels were faint. Placeholder text? Even worse. Light gray on light gray. I wasn't sure if a field was pre-filled or empty. On my work laptop—mid-range display, doesn't handle subtle gradients well—the borders between form fields were barely visible. I had to guess where to click.

**Borders and dividers:** If they used thin borders—#E0E0E0 or lighter—those disappeared on my screen. In a dim room later, when I turned down brightness to reduce eye strain, the same thing happened: sections blended together. No clear boundaries.

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

I went straight for the navigation. I assumed "Work," "Services," "About," "Contact" were links—standard structure. I couldn't distinguish them by color in the glare, but I clicked **About** first.

The About page title was readable: "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Good. They're a firm in Chicago. The body content? Same problem. Long paragraphs in light gray. I scanned for headings—those were darker, so I could read them. From the headings I gathered: digital product work, around since 2012, work with a lot of companies. The details? Lost. I skipped them.

I clicked **Services** next. "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." I saw section headings—web apps, mobile apps, Salesforce, AI automation. The headings helped. The descriptions under each? Light gray. Unreadable in my conditions. I got the gist from the headings alone: they build web and mobile apps, do Salesforce work, something with AI.

I also looked at **Work**. "Our Portfolio of Web & Mobile Software." So they make websites and mobile apps. I pieced it together. But I had to work for it. I relied entirely on headings and bold text. Everything else was a guess.

> "I wish more sites would use darker text and stronger borders. It's not that hard, and it would help everyone who isn't sitting in a perfectly lit room with a top-tier display."

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

I clicked **Contact** in the nav. The page loaded. First thing I saw: testimonials. Long quote blocks. I scrolled. More testimonials. I kept scrolling, looking for a form, a phone number, an email. The testimonials were in that faint gray—I couldn't read them anyway. Just blocks of gray blur.

I finally found the contact form. But the labels were light. The input borders were subtle. I wasn't sure where to click. I tabbed through the fields—could I see the focus indicator? Barely. If there was a thin outline or a slight color change, I missed it. In bright light or on my older monitor at home, a 2px outline in black or dark blue would be a lifeline. I didn't see one.

Did I find a phone number? An email? I'm not sure. If they were there, they might have been in small text or light gray. I was looking for "Connect with an Expert" or the form—that seemed to be the main call-to-action. But for someone browsing in suboptimal conditions, a visible phone number in big, dark text would help. I didn't see one prominently. Or if I did, it didn't register.

## Pain Points Related to Situational Contrast

1. **Body text washes out in sunlight.** Light gray (#666 or lighter) on white disappears when the screen is hit by glare. I tilt the laptop, cup my hand, increase brightness—it's tiring. The text should hold up without all that.

2. **Links indistinguishable in poor lighting.** I can't identify links by subtle color difference. In a dim room or on an old monitor, I need underlines, bold text, or a strong color. Without that, I'm guessing.

3. **Hover states invisible in glare.** Subtle hover effects—slight lightness shift, faint underline—don't exist when the screen is washed out. I need bold, background color, or thick underline.

4. **Testimonials wasted.** Long quote blocks in light gray? In sunlight or on a low-quality display, I skip them entirely. They might as well not be there.

5. **Form labels and placeholders too faint.** I need dark labels. Dark placeholder text. Dark borders on inputs. Otherwise I'm not sure what I'm filling out—especially when brightness is low or the display is aging.

6. **Focus indicators inadequate.** When I tab through the form, I need to see clearly where I am. A subtle outline doesn't cut it in any environment.

7. **Borders disappear.** Light borders (#E0E0E0 or lighter) between sections? In bright light or on a dim display, they're invisible. The page feels like one undifferentiated mass.

## What Worked Well (High Contrast Elements)

1. **Headlines and headings.** The main headlines—"AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development," "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago"—were dark enough. I could read those. They held up in the sunlight. They gave me an anchor.

2. **Navigation structure.** The nav had standard labels: Work, Services, About, Contact. I knew where to go. I didn't need to read fine print to find the main sections.

3. **Page titles.** Each page had a clear title at the top. That helped me know where I was.

4. **Primary buttons.** If "Connect with an Expert" or similar CTAs used a darker background or stronger color, they stood out. I could identify them as buttons even in glare.

5. **Logical flow.** The site structure made sense. About tells you what they do, Services gives details, Contact is for reaching out. I could complete the task despite the conditions—but only by relying on the high-contrast elements and skipping the rest.

## Overall Experience Rating

**2 out of 5**

I found what they do (digital product development, web and mobile apps, AI, Salesforce) and I found the Contact page. But I did it by ignoring most of the content. I read headings. I skipped body text. I couldn't read the testimonials. I'm not confident I found the phone number or email. The site felt designed for ideal viewing conditions. For me—at a coffee shop by the window, or at home on my older monitor—it was exhausting. I had to work too hard for basic information. If I had a choice between this site and a competitor with stronger contrast that holds up anywhere, I'd pick the competitor.

> "I don't have time to strain my eyes. I need strong contrast—black or dark gray on white. That's readable in any lighting. Everything else is a compromise I shouldn't have to make."
