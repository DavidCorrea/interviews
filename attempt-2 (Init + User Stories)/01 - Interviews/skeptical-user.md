## First Impressions (Trust Signals, Marketing Claims)

I landed on the homepage and the first thing I saw was "AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter." My immediate reaction: *Okay, but what does that actually mean?* "Results that Matter" — to whom? Measured how? That's the kind of phrase every agency slaps on their site. It could mean anything.

The page title said "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." "AI-centric" — I've seen that buzzword on a dozen vendor sites in the last year. Everyone's "AI-focused" or "AI-powered" now. I wanted to know: What do you actually do with AI? Custom models? Integrations? Chatbots? Or is it just marketing?

I scanned for trust signals. Client logos? I saw some—Prosci, CDK Global, Millennium Trust Company. Good. Those are real companies. But were they accompanied by context? What did LaunchPad Lab actually build for them? I couldn't tell from the homepage. Logos without project context are easy to fake or exaggerate.

> "I've been burned before. Vendors show logos, promise the moon, and deliver a crater. I need evidence—real case studies with real outcomes. Logos alone don't cut it."

## Skepticism About Vague Claims

I went through the site with a red pen in my head. Every claim got questioned:

- **"Your Strategic AI Partner"** — Strategic how? What's the strategy? Who defines it?
- **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise"** — "Modern enterprise" is meaningless. What industries? What scale?
- **"Driving ROI with AI"** — Show me the numbers. What ROI? For whom?
- **"Results that Matter"** — This is the definition of vague. Results measured how? Compared to what?
- **"12+ Years in Business, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients"** — Okay, these are numbers. But where's the source? When were they last updated? Are these cumulative or active? I'd want to verify.

The Services page said "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." Again—"AI-focused." I kept looking for specifics. Web apps, mobile apps, Salesforce, AI automation. Fine. But what does "AI automation" mean? RPA? LLM integrations? Custom ML? The language stayed high-level. I couldn't tell what I'd actually get if I hired them.

> "If you can't describe what you do in concrete terms, I assume you're either hiding something or you don't know. Both are red flags."

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does (Looking for Evidence)

I clicked **About** first. "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." So they're in Chicago. They're a firm. The page had more text—long paragraphs about digital products, software, AI. I skimmed. I got the gist: they build web and mobile apps, do Salesforce work, something with AI. But I had to piece it together. Nobody said it plainly: "We build X for Y in Z weeks."

I went to **Work** — "Our Portfolio of Web & Mobile Software." I was looking for case studies. Named clients. Measurable outcomes. "We built X for [Client], resulting in Y% improvement in Z." That's what I need. I saw client names—Prosci, CDK Global, Millennium Trust—but were there detailed case studies? Outcomes? Metrics? I couldn't find a dedicated case studies section. The Work page seemed to be more of a portfolio overview. If there were deep dives with numbers, they weren't obvious.

I checked **Services**. Same pattern. High-level descriptions. "Discovery process," "product strategy," "managed services." What does discovery cost? How long does it take? What deliverables do I get? Silence. "Contact us for a quote" — of course. Every agency does that. But the best ones at least give you a framework: "Typical discovery: 2–4 weeks, $X–$Y, includes A, B, C." This site gave me nothing.

> "I looked for case studies with measurable outcomes. I found client names and testimonials. I did not find 'increased conversions by 23%' or 'reduced load time by 40%.' One testimonial mentioned '7% increase in online membership sales' — that's the only specific number I saw. One. In a quote. Not in a case study."

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

I saw "Connect with an Expert" in the nav. Not "Contact." "Connect with an Expert." That's marketing language. I was looking for "Contact." I clicked anyway—it took me to the Contact page. Fine. But the label felt like a soft sell. "Connect with an Expert" implies I'm about to get a sales conversation, not a simple way to reach someone.

The Contact page was a wall of testimonials. Long quotes. One after another. I was trying to find a phone number, an email, a form. I had to scroll past paragraph after paragraph of praise. Why are testimonials on the contact page? That's a design choice that puts social proof before utility. I get it—they want to reassure me before I reach out. But for someone like me, it felt like they were hiding the contact details behind a curtain of flattery.

I kept scrolling. I found the contact info—email (contact@launchpadlab.com), phone ((312) 888-9651). They were there. But they weren't prominent. They were buried below the testimonials. If I'd been in a hurry, I might have missed them or given up.

> "Put the contact information at the top. If I want to reach you, I shouldn't have to scroll past five testimonials to find your email. That feels like you're more interested in selling me than helping me."

## Pain Points (Vague Language, Missing Specifics, Dark Patterns)

1. **No pricing information.** Not even a framework. "Contact us for a quote" is the only option. I have no idea what a typical project costs. $50K? $500K? I can't compare them to other vendors without that. It forces me to engage before I know if we're in the same ballpark. That's a trust reducer.

2. **Testimonials without full attribution.** The quotes on the Contact page—do they have names? Companies? Roles? I'd need to look again. If they're anonymous or just first names, they're not credible. "John from Acme said we're great" — I can't verify that.

3. **One measurable outcome in a testimonial.** "7% increase in online membership sales and general admission tickets" — that's specific. That's evidence. But it's buried in a quote, not in a case study. Where's the full story? What did they build? How long did it take? One data point in a sea of vague praise isn't enough.

4. **"Connect with an Expert" instead of "Contact."** Minor, but it signals a sales-first approach. I want to contact you. I don't want to "connect with an expert" — that sounds like I'm signing up for a webinar.

5. **No clear process description.** What are the steps? Discovery, then what? Design? Development? How long does each phase take? What do I get at each milestone? The site describes services at a high level but doesn't give me a process I can evaluate.

6. **No "we don't do" section.** Every vendor claims they do everything. The honest ones say "We focus on X. We don't do Y." That builds trust. This site doesn't acknowledge limitations. That makes me wonder what they're not telling me.

7. **Contact info buried below testimonials.** Already mentioned. But it's a pattern: the site prioritizes persuasion over utility. For a skeptical user, that backfires.

## What Worked Well (Real Case Studies, Specific Details)

1. **Named clients.** Prosci, CDK Global, Millennium Trust Company—these are real, verifiable companies. I could look them up. That's better than "Fortune 500 clients" or "industry leaders" with no names.

2. **One testimonial with a number.** "The first full year our system was in place, we saw a 7% increase in both online membership sales and general admission tickets." That's specific. That's evidence. I wish there were more like it—and that they lived in case studies, not just quotes.

3. **Chicago location.** They're upfront about where they're based. No fake "global presence" without substance.

4. **Statistics (with caveats).** 12+ years, 730+ projects, 240+ clients—numbers are better than no numbers. I'd want to verify, but at least they're putting something out there.

5. **Standard navigation.** Work, Services, About, Contact (or "Connect with an Expert"). I could find my way around. The structure wasn't trying to be clever.

6. **No obvious dark patterns.** I didn't see fake urgency ("Limited spots!"), pre-checked newsletter signups, or bait-and-switch CTAs. That's a low bar, but some sites fail it. This one didn't.

## Overall Rating

**2 out of 5**

I completed the task. I know what LaunchPad Lab does—they're a digital product development firm that builds web and mobile apps, does Salesforce work, and has an AI focus. I found their contact information. But I wouldn't trust them enough to reach out without doing more homework. The site is heavy on marketing language and light on evidence. One testimonial with a real number. No pricing framework. No detailed case studies. No clear process. Testimonials dominating the contact page. For a skeptical buyer like me, that's not enough. I'd need to see case studies with measurable outcomes, a clearer process description, and at least a pricing range before I'd pick up the phone.

> "I've been burned by vendors who looked great on paper and delivered nothing. This site doesn't give me enough to distinguish them from the ones who overpromise. Show me the evidence. Show me the process. Show me you're not hiding behind buzzwords. Then I might trust you."
