## First Impressions

I opened the site and immediately hit Tab. Nothing. I hit Tab again. Still nothing. I kept tabbing—maybe five or six times—before anything happened. I was expecting a "Skip to main content" link. Every site should have one. I never found it.

> "I tab through the navigation because clicking those small links is a gamble—my hand shakes and I hit the wrong thing."

When focus finally landed, it was on the logo or the first nav link. I couldn't tell where. The focus indicator was either invisible or so faint I missed it. I had to tab back and forth a few times just to confirm I was on the right element. That's exhausting before I've even started.

## Navigation Challenges

The main navigation has links: Work, Services, About, Contact. Good—those are standard. But the links themselves felt small. When I tried to click "Services" with my mouse once—just to see—I overshot and hit "About" instead. My tremor does that. I went back to the keyboard.

Tab order seemed logical enough—left to right through the nav, then down the page. But I hit a lot of focusable elements. Social icons, maybe. Small things. I lost count of how many tabs it took to get from the header to the main content. A skip link would have cut that in half.

> "Give me things I can tab to and hit Enter. Make the clickable areas big. And for heaven's sake, show me where my focus is."

I didn't see any dropdown menus that required hover—or if I did, I didn't notice because I was tabbing. That's actually a relief. Hover menus are the worst. My cursor drifts; I trigger the wrong one, or it closes before I can click. If they have dropdowns, they'd better open on focus or Enter. I didn't test that thoroughly.

## Difficulty with Small Targets and Precision Clicking

The "Learn More" links—or whatever they call them—on the service cards or case studies? Tiny. I'd guess they're under 44 pixels. I tried clicking one. Missed. Tried again. Missed. On the third try I hit it, but by then I was frustrated. I shouldn't have to try three times.

> "Those little 'Learn More' links and tiny arrows? I'll miss them half the time."

Arrow icons for carousels or "next" buttons—same problem. Small hit areas. I prefer big buttons. The main "Connect with an Expert" or "Contact" button was better. I could land on that. But the secondary links? Too small. Too precise.

I didn't run into any drag-and-drop, which is good. I can't do that. If they had reordering or something that required dragging, I'd be stuck.

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

I tabbed to "About" and hit Enter. The page loaded. The headline said something like "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Okay—they're a firm in Chicago. I scrolled down with the keyboard—Page Down, Arrow keys. More text about digital products, AI, web and mobile development. I got the gist: they build websites and apps for businesses.

I also went to Services. Same idea—AI-focused development, web apps, mobile apps, Salesforce. The service cards had icons and text. I could read them. But the links inside the cards—the ones that take you to more detail—were small. I tabbed to them rather than clicking.

> "I need to find software vendors for work. I'll tab through the navigation because clicking those small links is a gamble."

I figured out what they do. It took some reading, but the content was there. The main headline on the homepage—"AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development"—gave me the core message. I'd have preferred a plainer sentence, but I got it.

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

I tabbed to "Contact" in the nav and hit Enter. The Contact page loaded. "Contact Us" at the top. Good.

Then I hit a wall of testimonials. Long quotes. Paragraph after paragraph. I had to tab and scroll through all of it. I was looking for a phone number or email. I kept going. Tab, Tab, Tab. Down, Down, Down.

> "Why put testimonials before the contact form? I'm trying to reach you, not read your reviews."

When I finally reached the contact form, I could tab through the fields. Name, email, company, message. The labels seemed to be there—I could tell which field was which. But the fields themselves felt cramped. Small. I worry about hitting the wrong thing when my hand shakes. A bigger hit area for each input would help.

I found the phone number and email eventually. They were there, but buried. I'd have preferred them right at the top—big, bold, impossible to miss. I can call. I don't always want to fill out a form. Forms take longer. More precision. More chances to mess up.

## Pain Points

**No skip link:** I had to tab through the entire header—logo, nav links, maybe social icons—on every page. No "Skip to main content." No "Skip to contact form." That's basic. Every site should have it.

**Invisible or faint focus indicators:** I couldn't always tell where my focus was. Sometimes it looked like nothing was focused. I had to tab and watch the screen carefully. If the outline was removed or too light, that's a problem. I need to see it. Always.

**Small click targets:** "Learn More" links, arrow icons, maybe some nav items—all too small. Under 44 pixels. I need 44×44 minimum. My tremor makes precise clicking a nightmare. I'll miss small targets half the time.

**Contact info buried:** Testimonials before the form. Contact details not at the top. I had to scroll and tab through a lot to get there. Key information should be findable without that much work.

**Forms:** The contact form was reachable by keyboard, which is good. But the fields felt small. I didn't test validation or error messages. If errors appear and focus doesn't move to them, I might not notice. And if the form times out—I hope it doesn't. I need time. I move slowly.

**No keyboard traps (that I found):** I didn't get stuck in a modal or carousel. I could tab out. That's good. But I didn't test every widget. Carousels can be tricky—do they have visible Previous/Next buttons? Can you pause them? I didn't dig that deep.

## What Worked Well

**Keyboard navigation:** I could reach the main nav links, the main content, and the contact form by tabbing. Tab order was logical. I didn't hit any obvious keyboard traps.

**Main CTA button:** The "Connect with an Expert" or primary contact button was large enough. I could land on it. Good size.

**Clear labels:** Work, Services, About, Contact—standard, familiar. I knew where to go.

**No hover-only critical content:** I didn't encounter content or functionality that appeared only on hover. If there were tooltips, they weren't blocking me. Dropdowns—if any—didn't seem to require hover. That's a relief.

**Logical structure:** The pages had a clear flow. About told me what they do. Contact had the form and details. I got there. Eventually.

## Overall Rating

**3 out of 5**

I completed the task. I figured out what LaunchPad Lab does—they're a digital product firm that builds web and mobile apps, AI solutions, Salesforce work—and I found the contact information. But it cost me. No skip link meant extra tabbing. Faint or missing focus indicators made me lose my place. Small "Learn More" links and similar targets required multiple attempts when I tried to click. The contact page buried the important stuff under testimonials.

> "I'd probably still reach out if I needed their services. But I wouldn't enjoy the experience. Add a skip link. Make the focus visible. Make the targets bigger. Put contact info at the top. Simple changes that would make a huge difference."

## Summary

Marcus Okonkwo successfully completed the task of finding what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them, using keyboard navigation as his primary method. He avoided mouse use for small targets due to essential tremor. Key barriers included: no skip link, invisible or faint focus indicators, small click targets (under 44×44px) for secondary links and icons, and contact information buried below testimonials. Improvements to skip links, focus visibility, target size, and contact page structure would substantially improve the experience for users with motor impairment.
