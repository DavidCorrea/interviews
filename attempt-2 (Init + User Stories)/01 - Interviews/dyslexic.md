## First Impressions

I landed on the homepage and my first thought was: *Okay, another agency site. Let's see if I can actually get through this.*

The hero area was fine—big headline, "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." I got that right away. The words didn't swim. But as I scrolled down, I could feel it coming. More text. Blocks of it. My eyes started doing that thing where letters feel like they're shifting, and I had to re-read a sentence twice to make sure I got "form" and not "from."

> "I'm used to agency sites being wordy. I just hoped this one would have some mercy."

The overall look was clean—modern, professional. But clean doesn't always mean readable. I could tell there was a lot of information, and I wasn't sure I'd be able to extract what I needed without getting exhausted.

## Finding What the Company Does

I tried to use the headings. That's my go-to strategy—scan the H2s and H3s, get the outline, then dip into the bits I care about. I looked for "What We Do" or "Services" or "About" in the nav. The navigation was there, which helped. I clicked through to Services and About.

**What worked:**
- The main headline on the homepage was clear: they do AI-focused digital product design and development. I didn't have to dig for that.
- Section headings gave me a rough map. I could tell there were chunks about services, work, and testimonials.
- Bullet points, when they appeared, were a relief. Short lines. One idea per line. I could process those.

**What didn't:**
- Long paragraphs about their process, their approach, their philosophy. I skimmed. I probably missed nuance. I don't care—I needed the gist.
- Dense testimonial blocks. The contact page especially. Quote after quote, full sentences, no bullets. I had to work to get through them. "Their attention to detail in the discovery process, and their selective choice of questioning..." — I lost the thread. I had to re-read.
- Some sections felt like walls of text. No visual breaks. No icons or diagrams to anchor me. Just words.

I did eventually figure it out: they build web and mobile apps, do Salesforce work, AI automation, product strategy. But it took more effort than it should have.

> "I got there. I always do. But I was tired by the end."

## Finding Contact Information

This was frustrating. I went to the Contact page expecting a form, maybe a phone number, an email. Instead, the first thing I hit was testimonials. Long ones. Multiple paragraphs of client praise. I had to scroll past all of that to find the actual contact form and details.

> "Why put testimonials before the contact form? I'm trying to reach you, not read your reviews."

When I finally found the form, the labels were okay. But the layout felt cramped in places. Small text for some helper text or disclaimers. I had to zoom to 125% to feel comfortable, and I worried about whether the form would still work properly—sometimes zoom breaks things.

I didn't see a phone number or email immediately. I had to look. For someone like me, a visible phone number or "Email us at X" is a lifeline. Forms are fine, but they require more reading, more focus. A phone number is a few digits. I can handle that.

## Pain Points Related to Dyslexia

**Text density:** Too many long paragraphs. I avoid sustained reading. When there's no structure—no bullets, no short subheadings—I either skip or misread. I caught myself mixing up "their" and "there" in one testimonial. Small thing, but it breaks flow.

**Typography:** I didn't love the font choices. Some body text felt small. Line height in a few sections felt tight—the lines ran together. I prefer 1.5 or more. And if there's justified text anywhere, I didn't notice it explicitly, but I'm always wary. Justified text creates those "rivers" of white space that mess with my tracking.

**Testimonials:** These were the worst. Long quote blocks, italicized or styled as quotes. Dense. No summaries. I would have loved a one-line takeaway per client, with the full quote as optional. Instead, I had to wade through prose.

**Fatigue:** By the time I'd visited the homepage, About, Services, and Contact, I was done. Reading takes longer for me. I had to take a mental break. A site that chunks information better would have saved me energy.

**All-caps and decorative text:** I didn't see a ton, but any all-caps headings or labels are harder for me. Letter shape matters. All-caps reduces that.

## What Worked Well

**Visual hierarchy:** The homepage had a clear structure. Big headline, then sections. I could tell what was important.

**Headings:** When headings were present and logical (H1, H2, H3), I could navigate. I used them to skim. That's how I found Services and About.

**Short lines in some places:** Where they used bullets or short phrases, I could parse quickly. Less cognitive load.

**Clean layout:** No crazy backgrounds or distracting animations in the main content. That helped. I didn't have to fight visual noise.

**Responsive feel:** The site seemed to reflow. I didn't test zoom extensively, but at 125% things didn't obviously break. That's good.

## Overall Experience Rating

**3 out of 5**

I completed the task. I found what they do (AI-focused digital product development, web/mobile apps, Salesforce, strategy) and I found the contact page. But it cost me. I had to work harder than a typical reader would. The testimonials on the contact page felt like a barrier. The density of text in several sections made me want to leave. The structure was good enough to get me through, but it wasn't comfortable.

> "I'd probably still reach out if I needed their services. But I wouldn't enjoy the experience. And if I had a choice between this site and a competitor with clearer, chunked content, I'd pick the competitor."

## Summary

Jordan Chen successfully completed the task of finding what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them. The site's visual hierarchy and headings helped, but dense text blocks—especially testimonials—created significant barriers. Typography (font size, line height) and text density were the main pain points. The experience was functional but fatiguing, and improvements to chunking, typography, and the placement of contact information would substantially improve the experience for users with dyslexia.
