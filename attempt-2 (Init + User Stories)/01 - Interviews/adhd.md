## First Impressions

I landed on the homepage and my eyes went everywhere at once. There's a lot going on—some kind of headline about AI and digital products, but then I immediately noticed a row of logos. Client logos, I think? Harvard, Northwestern, Whirlpool... My brain latched onto those instead of the main message. *Wait, what am I supposed to be reading?*

The page felt busy. Not overwhelming in a "this is ugly" way, but in a "where do I look first?" way. I could tell there was motion—something animating or fading in as I scrolled. I caught myself watching that instead of reading.

> *"I just wanted a quick answer. What do you do? How do I reach you? That's it. But the page kept giving me more."*

## What I Noticed First (and What Distracted Me)

**First thing that caught my eye:** The client logos. They're everywhere. I started counting them and then forgot why I was there.

**Then:** A bunch of numbers—12+ years, 730+ projects, 4.8 rating. Those actually helped. Numbers are easy. I can process numbers.

**Distractions:**
- Award badges. There are a lot of them. Clutch, Inc. 5000, something else. I didn't need to see all of them right away. Two or three would have been enough.
- Multiple buttons that all said similar things. "Learn More," "Get Started," "See Our Work." I didn't know which one to click. I clicked the first one I saw.
- Testimonials with long quotes. When I got to the Contact page, the first thing I saw was a wall of quote marks. I almost closed the tab. *I'm trying to find your email, not read what your clients think.*

## Finding What the Company Does

I skimmed the headline. Something about "AI-centric digital product design and development." Okay, so they build software? Apps? I wasn't 100% sure.

I scrolled. More sections. "Our Services" had a bunch of boxes—AI Automation, Web Apps, Mobile Apps, something about "agentic AI." I don't know what "agentic" means. I didn't stop to look it up. I just moved on.

The About page helped a little. "Award-winning digital product firm in Chicago." Fine. But I had to click through to get that. The homepage didn't spell it out in one clear sentence at the top.

> *"I wish there was just one line at the very top: 'We build custom software and AI solutions for businesses.' Done. I could have left in five seconds."*

## Finding Contact Information

This is where I got frustrated.

**Header:** I looked for Contact in the nav. I think it was there? Or maybe I had to hover over something. I don't remember. I didn't see a phone number or email in the header. That would have been ideal.

**Footer:** I scrolled down. Way down. The homepage is long. I passed services, case studies, testimonials, more logos. Finally hit the footer. I think there was contact info there, but it wasn't the first thing I saw. More links, more text.

**Contact page:** I clicked Contact. The page loaded and—testimonials. A whole section of testimonials before the form. I had to scroll past five or six long quotes to get to the actual contact form. Why are testimonials *above* the form? I'm here to reach you, not to be sold.

The form itself had several fields. Name, email, company, a dropdown, message. It felt like a lot. I would have preferred just name, email, and message. Or even better—a phone number and email right there so I could just call or email instead.

> *"I almost gave up. I was like, just give me an email. One email. I'll figure it out from there."*

## Pain Points and Frustrations

1. **Too many choices.** Six service boxes, multiple CTAs, lots of "Learn More" buttons. I didn't know where to go. Decision paralysis.

2. **Contact buried.** Had to go to a separate page and scroll past testimonials. Phone and email weren't in the header. I had to work to find them.

3. **Long blocks of text.** Some paragraphs were four or five lines. I skipped them. Bullet points would have been better.

4. **Jargon.** "Agentic AI," "bespoke," "cross-functional." I glossed over those. Plain language would have helped.

5. **Motion.** Things were animating. I'm not sure if it was scroll effects or carousels, but my attention kept getting pulled. I have reduced motion on my system—I'm not sure the site respected it.

6. **No skip links.** I didn't see "Skip to main content" or "Skip to contact." On a long page, that would have saved me a lot of scrolling.

7. **Testimonials before contact.** On the Contact page, testimonials came first. I had to scroll to get to the form. That felt backwards.

## What Worked Well

- **The numbers.** 12+ years, 730+ projects, 4.8 rating—easy to process. I liked those.
- **Clear nav labels.** Work, Services, About, Contact. I could find Contact eventually.
- **The page titles.** When I opened tabs, the titles told me where I was. That helped when I got distracted and forgot which tab was which.
- **The form was there.** Once I found it, I could use it. It wasn't broken. Just felt like more work than necessary.

## Overall Experience

**Rating: 2.5 / 5**

I found what I needed, but it took longer than it should have. I had to click, scroll, and filter through a lot of content that wasn't directly answering my questions. The site feels built for someone who wants to explore. I wanted to grab the answer and go.

> *"I'd use them if I had a project. The info is there. But I wouldn't enjoy the experience. It felt like the site was fighting my brain instead of working with it."*

## Summary

Jordan (ADHD persona) completed the task of finding what LaunchPad Lab does and how to contact them, but experienced significant friction. Key issues: visual clutter and competing elements, buried contact information, long text blocks, jargon, and lack of skip links or clear hierarchy. The site would benefit from a single clear value proposition at the top, contact info in the header, fewer CTAs per viewport, and a Contact page that leads with the form—not testimonials.
