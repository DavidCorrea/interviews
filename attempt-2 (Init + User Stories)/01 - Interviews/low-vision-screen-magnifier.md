## First Impressions (Viewing at High Magnification)

When I first loaded the homepage at 300% zoom, I saw maybe one-quarter of what a normal user sees. My viewport is like a small window—roughly 640 by 360 pixels on my screen. I got a big headline and part of it immediately.

> "At 300% zoom, I see maybe one service box at a time. The logos section? I had to pan left and right about eight times just to see all twelve."

The first thing I noticed was a horizontal scrollbar. That's a bad sign. Good sites reflow to a single column so I only scroll up and down. Horizontal panning means the design is broken. I immediately knew I was in for a fight.

I could see the top of the hero—something about "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." I had to pan right to see the rest of the headline. The main headline was split across my viewport edge. I lost track of the full sentence until I panned back.

## Context Loss and Navigation Difficulties

I lose context constantly. When magnified, headings get separated from their content by viewport boundaries. I'll be reading a heading and then scroll down and suddenly I'm in a different section. I didn't know where I was half the time.

> "I lose context constantly—I'll be reading a heading and then scroll down and suddenly I'm in a different section."

The worst was the multi-column sections. Services, logos, case studies—they were laid out in grids. At 300% zoom, I could only see one service box at a time. The logos section? I had to pan left and right about eight times just to see all twelve. I had to remember what I'd seen: pan right, right, right, scroll down, pan left, left, left, then right again. It was exhausting.

Large images dominated my viewport. I'd scroll and suddenly a huge image would fill my entire screen. I couldn't see what was above or below it. Decorative graphics wasted space. I couldn't tell if I was still in the same section or had moved to a new one.

I counted: roughly 15 horizontal pans on the homepage alone, versus maybe 8 vertical scrolls. That ratio is backwards. Vertical scrolling is acceptable. Horizontal panning is a critical failure.

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

I looked for the main navigation. The header was sticky—it stayed at the top. At 300% zoom, that sticky header took up maybe 30–40% of my visible area. I could see "Work," "Services," "About," and "Contact" but I had to pan to see the full menu. Sometimes the menu might have been a hamburger—I'm not sure. I could only see part of the header at once.

I tried to read the hero headline. "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." I had to pan right twice to see the full text. I got the gist: they do digital product design. But I wanted more—what does that mean in practice?

I clicked on **About**. The page title said "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Good. But the page content was long. I had to scroll and scroll. At 300% zoom, I could only see a few lines of text at a time. I lost track of which paragraph I was in. I didn't find a simple one-sentence summary of what they do. I had to piece it together.

I clicked on **Services**. Same problem. Multi-column layout. I could see one service box at a time. I had to pan right to see the next, then scroll down, pan left, pan right again. I eventually got the idea: web apps, mobile apps, AI, Salesforce. But it took me a long time.

> "Good sites reflow to a single column so I only scroll up and down."

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

I clicked **Contact** in the nav. The Contact page loaded. The first thing I saw was... testimonials. Long quotes from clients. I couldn't see the contact form or anything useful. I had to scroll down—a lot.

At 300% zoom, each testimonial block took up most of my viewport. I'd scroll, scroll, scroll. More quotes. I was looking for a phone number, an email, an address. I kept scrolling. I wasn't sure if the contact form was below the fold or if I was missing it.

> "I was trying to find a phone number or email, and I had to scroll past all these quotes."

I didn't see a "Skip to contact" link. That would have saved me. I had to scroll past all the testimonials to get to the form. When I finally found it, the form was there—but I'm not sure I ever found the phone number or email in plain text. If they're there, they might be at the bottom or in the footer. I had to pan and scroll so much I may have missed them.

I would have loved a skip link: "Skip to main content" or "Skip to contact." That would have saved me significant scrolling.

## Pain Points Related to Magnification

1. **Horizontal scrolling.** The biggest failure. At 200%, 300%, and 400% zoom, horizontal scrollbars appeared. Content did not reflow to fit my viewport. I had to pan left and right constantly. I counted: roughly 15 horizontal pans on the homepage, 8 on the About page, 10+ on the Services page.

2. **Content cut off at viewport edges.** Text, buttons, and images were frequently cut off. I didn't know a "Learn More" button existed until I scrolled down. Words were split across the viewport edge. Overlapping or cramped layouts made some content unreadable when zoomed.

3. **Headings separated from content.** When I scrolled, I'd see a heading at the bottom of my screen and the content below it at the top of the next "screen." I'd lose the connection. "Which section is this?" I'd ask myself.

4. **Sticky header consuming too much space.** At 300% zoom, the sticky header occupied 30–40% of my visible area. That's valuable real estate. I couldn't see much content below it.

5. **Large images dominating the viewport.** Case study screenshots, decorative graphics—they filled my entire screen. I couldn't see surrounding content. I'd scroll and suddenly be in a sea of image with no context.

6. **Grid layouts forcing horizontal panning.** Services, logos, case studies, statistics—all in multi-column grids. None reflowed to single column at 300% zoom. I had to pan right, right, right, scroll down, pan left, left, right. It was a puzzle.

7. **No skip links.** I had to scroll through everything. A "Skip to main content" or "Skip to contact" would have saved me a lot of effort.

## What Worked Well

1. **The navigation labels were clear.** "Work," "Services," "About," "Contact"—I knew what those meant. I could find them even if I had to pan to see the full menu.

2. **Page titles were descriptive.** "Contact Us," "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago"—I knew where I was when I landed on a page.

3. **The main headline was readable.** Once I panned to see it, "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development" was clear. I could read it at 300% zoom.

4. **No text embedded in images.** I didn't find critical text that was unreadable because it was in an image. That's good.

5. **At 200% zoom, the experience was slightly better.** Fewer horizontal pans. But at 300% and 400%, it fell apart.

## Overall Experience Rating

**2 out of 5**

I was able to complete the task—I figured out they build web and mobile apps, do AI and Salesforce work, and I found the Contact page. But it was exhausting. The horizontal scrolling was the worst. I had to pan constantly. I lost context constantly. I'm not sure I ever found the phone number or email in plain text. If I had to contact them for real, I might ask my daughter to help me or use a screen reader to navigate faster. The site felt like it was designed for people who see the full layout at 100% zoom. At 300%, I was fighting the design every step of the way.
