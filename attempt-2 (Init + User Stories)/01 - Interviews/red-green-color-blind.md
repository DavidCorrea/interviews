# Accessibility Interview: Red-Green Color Blind Persona (Deuteranopia)

**Persona:** Marcus Williams  
**Website:** https://launchpadlab.com/  
**Date:** February 16, 2025  
**Task:** Find what the company does and how to contact them

## First Impressions (Color Perception)

When I first landed on the LaunchPad Lab homepage, my immediate thought was: *"Please don't let this be another red-and-green nightmare."* I've evaluated dozens of agency sites for my company, and the number that rely on red/green for status, validation, or hierarchy is staggering. I can't tell them apart—they both look like yellowish beige or muddy brown to me.

The site looked clean. I could see a headline: "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." Good—that's text. I didn't need color to understand it. But I was already scanning for trouble: links, buttons, form validation, any badges or status indicators. If they use red for errors and green for success, I'm sunk. If they use green for "go" buttons and red for "urgent," I can't tell which is which. I've abandoned contact forms before when validation feedback was color-only.

> *"I've had deuteranopia since birth. Red and green are the same color to me. Every time I see a form or a status indicator, I brace myself."*

The overall palette seemed to lean toward blues and grays—which is a relief. Blue is the one color I can usually rely on. But I had to dig deeper. Navigation links, CTAs, form fields, any charts or case study graphics—those would tell the real story.

## Elements That Were Hard to Distinguish

**Links vs. body text:** If links are styled in red or green—or even orange, yellow, or brown—they blend into body text for me. I couldn't tell at a glance which text was clickable. I looked for underlines. I looked for blue. Navigation items like "Services," "Work," "About," "Contact"—were they underlined? Did they use blue? If they used a reddish or greenish accent, I'd have to hover or tab to confirm. I've learned to rely on position and labels, but when everything looks the same muddy tone, I second-guess myself.

**Primary vs. secondary buttons:** If the main CTA is green ("Get started," "Connect with an Expert") and secondary options are gray or outlined, I might see two similar-looking buttons. Green reads as yellowish-brown to me. A gray outline vs. a green fill—the fill might not stand out. I need borders, size differences, or icons to tell them apart. If both use similar treatments and differ only by green vs. blue vs. red, I'm lost.

**Form validation:** This is my biggest fear. If the contact form uses red borders for errors and green for success—or red text for "invalid email" and green for "submitted"—I cannot see the difference. They look identical. I need an icon (✗ for error, ✓ for success) and clear text. I need to know *which* field has the error, not just that something is wrong. Red asterisks on required fields? Invisible to me. I need "Required" labels or another cue.

**Status badges or tags:** If the site uses colored badges—green for "active," red for "inactive," or category tags that differ only by red/green—those are meaningless. I've seen portfolio sites where project status or filters use red/green. Useless.

**Charts and data visualizations:** If case studies or metrics use red and green in bar charts, pie charts, or process diagrams without labels or patterns, I can't interpret them. Red-yellow-green traffic light gradients? Same problem. I need text on each segment, or patterns (stripes, dots), or a legend with words—not just color swatches.

> *"Traffic light metaphors are the worst. Red = stop, green = go—I've never been able to see that. Give me position, give me an icon, give me text. Never just color."*

## How I Tried to Find What the Company Does

**Homepage:** The main headline was clear: "AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development." Text-based. I didn't need color. That told me they do digital product work with an AI focus. Good start.

**Navigation:** I looked for Services and About. The nav had "Work," "Services," "About," "Contact," "Industries." I could find them by label. I didn't need color-coded sections. I clicked **Services** first. The page title said "AI-Focused Digital Product Development Services." Section headings mentioned web apps, mobile apps, Salesforce, AI automation. I got the gist from headings and structure. If the cards or sections used colored borders or icons—blue, green, red—I relied on the icon shapes and text. Blue accents would have been fine; red or green accents would have blended together.

**About page:** "About Our Digital Product Firm in Chicago." Founded in 2012. Digital product design and development. The content was text-driven. I didn't need a color-coded timeline or diagram. As long as headings and copy were clear, I could understand their story.

**Work/Portfolio:** "Our Portfolio of Web & Mobile Software." Case studies, project cards. If any used red/green status indicators or category tags that differed only by color, I'd have been stuck. I'd look for text labels on filters and cards. Icons help. Blue for primary actions would be ideal.

> *"The copy did the work. I understood they do AI automation, web and mobile development, UX/UI design, consulting. I didn't need a color-coded diagram. But I was always watching for the moment color would fail me."*

## How I Tried to Find Contact Information

**Locating the Contact page:** I looked for "Contact" in the main navigation. It was there. Standard placement. I didn't have to hunt through a footer or hidden menu. The link itself—whether it was blue, red, or green—I found it by position and label. If it had been red or green with no underline, I might have missed it. Blue would have helped. Underline would have helped.

**Contact form:** This is where I get nervous. I scrolled to the form. I needed to know: Are required fields marked only by a red asterisk? If so, I won't see it. Do error states use only red borders or red text? If so, I won't know which field failed. Does success use only a green checkmark or green background? I need an icon and text. "Your message has been sent" with a ✓—that works. A green banner with no text—useless.

I'd use keyboard navigation to tab through the form. I'd look for focus indicators—a visible outline, not a subtle color change. If focus is indicated only by a faint blue or green ring, I might not see it. I need a 2px outline in a color I can perceive. Blue works. Black works. Red or green—unreliable.

**Footer:** I'd check for a phone number or email. If they're in small text or styled in red/green, I might miss them. I'd use Cmd+F to search for "contact" or "email" if links were hard to spot.

> *"Contact was in the nav. I found it. But the form—that's the real test. If validation is color-only, I can't complete it confidently. I've left sites before when I couldn't tell if my submission worked or which field had an error."*

## Pain Points Related to Color

1. **Red/green status indicators:** Any success (green) vs. error (red) that relies only on color is useless. Form validation, alerts, badges—if I can't see the difference, I'm blocked.

2. **Links in red or green:** If links use red (common for "required" or "error") or green (for "success" or "go"), they blend with body text. I need underlines, blue, or explicit styling.

3. **Required field indicators:** Red asterisks or red borders on required fields are invisible. I need "Required" labels or icons.

4. **Charts and graphs:** Red/green data visualizations without labels or patterns are unreadable. Case study metrics, process diagrams—if color is the only differentiator, I lose the information.

5. **Traffic light metaphors:** Red = stop, green = go—without position or icons, I can't use them.

6. **Button hierarchy:** Primary (green?) vs. secondary (gray?) vs. danger (red?)—if they differ only by color, I can't tell which is which. I need fill vs. outline, size, or icons.

7. **Pink and light gray:** These can look similar. If error messages use light pink backgrounds or subtle red tints, they may blend with white or gray for me.

## What Worked Well (Non-Color Cues)

- **Clear headings and structure:** H1, H2, H3 hierarchy made it easy to scan. I didn't need color to understand the page layout.
- **Descriptive link labels:** "Services," "Work," "About," "Contact" are self-explanatory. I could find them by position and text.
- **Text-first value proposition:** The main message was in the headline—"AI-Centric Digital Product Design & Development"—not in a color-coded graphic.
- **Logical navigation:** Standard nav pattern. Contact visible. I could complete the task by following labels.
- **Blue as primary accent (if used):** Blue is the most reliable color for me. If the site uses blue for links and CTAs, I'd have an easier time. I'd need to verify.
- **Keyboard navigation:** Tab order and focusable elements help me discover links when visual cues fail. As long as focus is visible (not just a subtle color change), I can navigate.

> *"The structure is solid. Headings, labels, text—those carried me through. But I'm an advocate for accessibility in my own work. I expect vendors to do the same. Color-only cues are a dealbreaker."*

## Overall Experience Rating

**3 out of 5**

I could complete both tasks—understand what the company does and find how to contact them—because the content and structure were clear. The headline told me their focus. The nav had Contact. I didn't hit a hard blocker. But I was constantly on guard. I couldn't assume links were visible. I couldn't assume form validation would work for me. I'd need to actually submit the form to know. If the site uses red/green anywhere critical—validation, status, required fields—I'd be in trouble. As a senior engineer evaluating vendors, I'd note the risk. The experience would be significantly better with underlines on links, icons and text for form validation, and non-color differentiation for all critical UI elements.

## Summary Quote

> *"I found what I needed—they do AI-focused digital product design and development, and I can reach them through the Contact page. But I can't trust that form validation or any red/green indicators would work for me. The structure is good. The color dependency is the unknown. For a firm that builds digital products, I'd expect better."*
