### Task 1: First Impressions

I open the browser and type in the LaunchPad Lab address. The page loads, and the first thing I see is a large heading that reads: **"AI Innovation. Digital Solutions. Results that Matter."** Okay. That immediately gets my attention. "AI Innovation" — that's exactly what my board has been pushing me about. "Results that Matter" — I like that phrasing. It doesn't sound like empty tech jargon. It sounds like they understand that at the end of the day, I need outcomes, not buzzwords.

Beneath the heading, there's a paragraph: *"LaunchPad Lab helps organizations harness the power of AI through tailored consulting and product development services. From strategy to execution, we build high-impact digital products that modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth."* I'm reading this carefully. "Tailored consulting" — that's what I need. Someone who will sit with me and my team and figure out what AI can actually do for a logistics company with 600 people. "Modernize operations, reduce costs, and unlock growth." Every single one of those phrases resonates with me. This is the language I use in board meetings.

There's a button right here that says **"Connect with an Expert."** That's a nice, clear call to action. I appreciate that it doesn't say "Start your free trial" or "Sign up now" like so many tech sites. It says "Connect with an Expert," which implies I'll be talking to a person, not filling out some automated queue.

Now I look up at the navigation bar. I see: **Services, Technologies, Industries, Our Work, About Us, Insights, Contact.** Seven items. That's a lot of navigation options, but at least the labels are mostly plain English. "Services" and "Contact" I understand immediately. "Technologies" makes me a little nervous — I'm hoping that's not going to be a page full of acronyms. "Industries" — oh, that could be very useful. I want to see if they've worked with companies in logistics or distribution. "Our Work" — that sounds like case studies, which is exactly what I want to evaluate their credibility. "Insights" I assume is a blog.

I scroll down past the hero section. Below it, I see a row of logos under the text **"Trusted by Hundreds of Innovative Businesses."** I recognize several names: **Kawasaki, Harvard University, Whirlpool, Northwestern University, CDK Global, MD Anderson Cancer Center.** These are serious organizations. Not startups. Not little tech companies. These are enterprises and institutions with real complexity. That immediately boosts my confidence. If they've worked with Whirlpool and MD Anderson, they might understand the scale and operational complexity of a company like mine.

I continue scrolling. There's a section labeled **"Your Strategic AI Partner"** with the heading **"AI-Powered Digital Solutions for the Modern Enterprise."** The paragraph reads: *"At LaunchPad Lab, we combine deep expertise in product design and development with cutting-edge AI consulting to solve critical business challenges. We've helped hundreds of businesses across all industries solve complex problems that go beyond just ROI."* I like the phrase "go beyond just ROI." That tells me they're thinking about the bigger picture — employee productivity, customer satisfaction, operational resilience — not just a spreadsheet metric.

It also says: *"Whether you're just getting started with AI or scaling adoption across your organization, our cross-functional teams partner with you to deliver results."* The words "just getting started with AI" — that's me. That's exactly where Meridian is. I feel like this is written for someone in my position, which is reassuring. Though "cross-functional teams" is a phrase I've heard before but honestly couldn't define precisely. I'll let that go.

Continuing to scroll, I see a section called **"Driving ROI with AI"** with the heading **"Make AI Your Competitive Advantage."** Below it are six service boxes:

1. **AI Automation & Agentic AI** — "Enabling an autonomous digital workforce." That's intriguing but slightly intimidating. What does "agentic AI" mean? I don't know that term. But the description says "autonomous digital workforce," which I can sort of picture — like having digital assistants that handle routine tasks.
2. **Web Application Development** — "Bespoke, redefining experiences." Okay, I know what a web application is in general terms. But "bespoke" feels very marketing-speak.
3. **Mobile Application Development** — "Meeting users where they are." Straightforward enough.
4. **Salesforce Development** — "Solving business problems." We actually use Salesforce at Meridian for our CRM, so this is interesting.
5. **Product Strategy & Design** — "Agile, cross-functional expertise." There's that "agile" word again. I hear it everywhere. I think it means they work quickly and iteratively, but I'm never quite sure.
6. **Managed Services & Support** — "Operating as an extension of your team." Now *this* I understand perfectly. I don't want a vendor who drops off a product and disappears. I want a partner who sticks around.

Each of these has a "Learn More" link. They're clearly clickable, but I notice the text is relatively small for the link targets. With my progressive lenses, I need to look through the right part of the lens to focus on these smaller elements, and my wrist aches a bit as I position the mouse carefully over these cards. They seem to be large clickable areas though, which helps.

Scrolling further, I find a section called **"Problems We Solve"** with tabs: **Operational Efficiency, Modern Technology, Customer Engagement, Scalable Solutions, Expansive Resources, Speed to Market.** The "Operational Efficiency" tab is already selected and shows: *"Streamline processes with digital products to enhance productivity."* These tabs speak my language. Operational efficiency is my number one concern. Speed to market matters when we're rolling out new distribution capabilities. I appreciate that they've organized this around business problems, not technical solutions.

Below that, I see impressive numbers: **12+ Years in Business, 730+ Projects, 240+ Clients.** And the note that "90% work with us for longer than one year." That's a powerful retention stat. If 90% of their clients stay for more than a year, that tells me something about the quality of the relationship, not just the product.

There's a section called **"Our Signature Approach"** outlining three phases: **Discover, Deliver, Release.** Under "Discover" they talk about aligning on scope, priorities, outcomes, funding, roadmap, risks, and proof of concept. Under "Deliver" it's development with bi-weekly sprint releases and weekly syncs with the client. Under "Release" it's deployment with seamless handoff and ongoing support. I appreciate the structure. The weekly syncs are important to me — I don't want to hand something off and not hear back for months. The "bi-weekly sprint releases" — I'm not entirely sure what a "sprint" is in this context, but I gather it means they work in short bursts and show progress regularly. That's fine by me.

I notice another AI-focused section: **"Put AI to Work"** with the heading **"Transform how your business operates with custom AI solutions."** The text reads: *"The companies pulling ahead are using AI to automate repetitive work, improve decision-making, and deliver experiences their competitors can't match."* That creates a bit of urgency — exactly what my board has been telling me. The competitive pressure angle is well-placed.

Further down there's a case studies carousel showing three projects: **Millennium Trust Company** (3 new digital products, $1M+ new annual revenue), **Prosci** (5,400+ current users, 30+ countries), and **CDK Global** (90% reduction in training time). These are exactly the kind of results I want to see — real numbers, real companies. I spend a moment reading each one.

Below the case studies, there's a **"Related Content"** section with blog posts. One catches my eye: **"How Automated Intelligence Is Reshaping the Way Businesses Scale."** That sounds relevant. There's also one about the business value of building applications, and a Salesforce guide.

At the very bottom of the page, before the footer, there's a contact form with the heading **"Let's Build Something Great."** It asks for First Name, Last Name, Company Email, Company, and "How Can We Help You?" Simple. Five fields. No dropdown menus asking me to categorize my inquiry into 15 different buckets. I appreciate the simplicity.

The footer has their Chicago address, phone number **(312) 888-9651**, and social media links. It also confirms they're a **Salesforce Partner**, which is relevant to us.

**Overall first impression:** Professional. Clean. AI-forward without being intimidating. The language mostly speaks to business outcomes, not technical implementation. The client logos lend real credibility. I feel like this is a company that could potentially understand my world, though I'd need to dig deeper into their specific experience with logistics or distribution.

### Task 2: Understanding What They Do

I want to understand more about their AI capabilities specifically. From the homepage, I hover over "Services" in the navigation menu. A dropdown appears showing six service categories:

- **AI Automation**
- **Web App Development**
- **Mobile App Development**
- **Salesforce Development**
- **Product Strategy & Design**
- **Managed Services & Support**

There's also a descriptive blurb that says: *"Our cross-functional teams have the skills and experience to support the full digital product lifecycle, using proven methods to deliver more better and faster with AI at the core."* I notice the phrase "deliver more better and faster" — that's a bit grammatically awkward. Did they mean "deliver more, better, and faster"? A minor thing, but it makes me pause for a moment.

I click on **"AI Automation"** because that's the most relevant to what my board wants.

The page loads with a bold heading: **"Transform Business Operations with AI Automation and Agentic AI."** The subtext explains: *"AI automation and an agentic workforce remove bottlenecks with speed and scale. Businesses are seeing significant returns with increased operational efficiency, improved customer satisfaction, and enhanced decision-making capabilities."*

There's a prominent call to action: **"Book an AI Automation Assessment."** That's clear and actionable. It doesn't say "learn more" or "download a white paper" — it says "book an assessment," which implies a real conversation about my specific situation. I like that.

The next section is headed **"AI Automation and Agentic Work Built for Speed and Scale."** They explain: *"We know how to shift from manual processes to high-rev automated workflows that scale your operations and boosts performance—in weeks, not months."* The "weeks, not months" promise is bold but appealing. At Meridian, we can't afford a two-year transformation project. They also mention a "proprietary framework" for training, deploying, and scaling "autonomous AI agents." The word "autonomous" gives me slight pause — I'm imagining AI making decisions without human oversight, and for a logistics company, that could be risky. But the description also mentions "escalating when needed," so there's a human-in-the-loop element.

Below that are five capability areas:

1. **Autonomous Automation** — "AI automates repetitive, rules-based processes or tasks like intake, triage, and documentation." This is very relevant to us. We have mountains of paperwork in our distribution operations — intake forms, shipment documentation, triage of delivery issues.
2. **Agentic AI Deployment** — "Train digital agents to act independently—accessing data, following logic, and escalating when needed." Again, "agentic" is not a word I know, but the description helps.
3. **Integrated Data Workflows** — "Connect systems to give AI agents and your teams access to clean, actionable data." We definitely have siloed data across our warehouse management system, our CRM, and our fleet tracking tools.
4. **Business Logic Codification** — "Convert human knowledge into repeatable prompts and workflows that scale across your org." Hmm, "codification" and "prompts" — this is getting a bit technical. But the idea of turning our experienced dispatchers' knowledge into something the whole organization can use? That's powerful.
5. **Rapid AI Rollouts** — "From concept to launch in 6 weeks." Six weeks! That's very specific and very fast. I'm skeptical but intrigued.

Further down the page there's a section called **"Problems We Solve"** with a table that maps pain points to solutions:

| Problem | → | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Slow, Manual Processes | → | Intelligent automation that executes with precision and speed. |
| Siloed, Disconnected Systems | → | Integrated AI that pulls data from across your stack in real time. |
| Inconsistent Execution | → | Always-on agents that deliver consistent, rules-driven outcomes. |
| Limited Team Capacity | → | Autonomous agents that scale tasks without adding headcount. |
| Low Data Visibility | → | Structured data pipelines that power real-time decisions. |

I absolutely love this table. It speaks directly to the problems I face every day. "Slow, manual processes" — yes. "Siloed, disconnected systems" — absolutely. "Limited team capacity" — we've been struggling to hire. "Low data visibility" — I can't get a real-time view across our distribution network. The word "stack" in "across your stack" loses me a bit — I think they mean my collection of software systems — but overall, this section is remarkably clear and compelling.

The statistics are impressive: **60%+ reduction in repetitive manual work**, **3x faster response across service and support channels**, and **6 weeks to deploy a working AI solution.**

They outline their approach in four stages:

1. **AI Opportunity Workshop** (Free) — "Identify pain points, set goals, and align stakeholders in one session." Free! And a workshop format, not a sales pitch. I like that.
2. **Proof of Concept** (3-4 weeks) — "Build and test a real AI solution tied to business outcomes."
3. **Production Deployment** (2-3 months) — Full rollout integrated with my systems.
4. **Ongoing Optimization** — Continuous improvement.

This is exactly the kind of structured, phased approach that I could present to my board. Start with a free workshop, move to a small proof of concept, then scale. Low risk.

I also see case studies on this page: **Bullhorn** (AI-Enhanced Self-Service Hub), **Kawasaki** (Optimized Workflows with a Self-Service Portal), and **Prosci** (Digital Customer Experience in 8 Languages). There are "View Case Study" links for each.

At the bottom of the page there are FAQ sections with questions like "What is agentic AI?", "How do automation and digital agents work together?", "Do I need to change my tech stack?", and "How is data privacy and compliance handled?" These are exactly the questions I would ask. The fact that they've anticipated these questions tells me they understand their audience.

Now I want to see their full portfolio of work. I click **"Our Work"** in the navigation.

The page opens with the heading **"Our Work & Case Studies"** and the subtext: *"Whether you're looking to bring a new product to market, design a new app for your customers, or build technology to empower your internal teams, we're here to help."*

There's a filter button that says **"Select Industries"** — useful. I could filter to see work in my industry. But I notice there isn't an explicit "Logistics" or "Distribution" or "Supply Chain" industry option visible on the page. I'll have to look through the general list.

I scan the case studies. There are dozens — I count well over 40. The range is impressive:

- **Kawasaki** — optimized workflows with a self-service portal
- **Bullhorn** — AI-enhanced self-service hub
- **MD Anderson** — advanced cancer research
- **Whirlpool** — transformed testing labs with a scalable web app
- **Financial Services Firm** — AI process automation for a consumer lender
- **Healthcare Insurance Platform** — AI automation to streamline claim reviews
- **Actuarial Firm** — projects $2M profit increase with AI workflows
- **Harvard** — next-gen web-based application
- **American Truck Business Services** — unified tech platform for truck drivers

Wait — **American Truck Business Services** and **Kawasaki Engines**. Those are both in the transportation and logistics adjacent space. That gives me some confidence that they understand operational companies, not just software startups.

The case study titles are well-written, focused on outcomes: "How [Company] [achieved result] with [solution type]." They're not technical. They're results-oriented. This is how I'd want to hear about a project — what did it accomplish, not what technology stack was used.

I also visit the **About Us** page to understand who these people are. The heading reads: **"Our Award-Winning Digital Product Firm."** Since 2012, over 240 companies, award badges from Clutch. They list their leadership team: **Scott Weisman** (Co-Founder & CEO), **Ryan Francis** (Partner, President & Head of Sales), **Brendan Hennessy** (Co-Founder & CTO), and several VPs and managers. There's a VP of Design, VP of Client Growth, a Head of Product, Head of Delivery, and Business Development Managers. The team structure suggests a mature organization with clear roles — not a scrappy startup where one person does everything.

Under **"Why Partner With LaunchPad Lab?"** they list: Speed to Market, Flexible Agile Approach, Diverse Skills & Services, and Outcomes Driven. The "Outcomes Driven" section states: *"The projects we work on have consistently yielded impressive returns on investment (ROI)."* That's the bottom line for me and my board.

The numbers again: **13+ years in business, 730+ projects, 240+ clients.** Consistency.

**Summary of what I've learned about what they do:** They are an AI-focused consulting and digital product development firm. They help companies automate manual processes, integrate disconnected systems, and deploy AI agents — all wrapped in a structured, phased approach that starts with a free workshop. They have deep experience across industries, including some logistics-adjacent work. Their language is mostly accessible to a non-technical executive, with only occasional jargon that's easily overlooked.

### Task 3: Finding How to Contact Them

Finding how to contact LaunchPad Lab was one of the easiest parts of this experience.

First, the **"Contact"** link is right there in the main navigation bar, clearly labeled. No hunting required. It's the last item in the nav — Services, Technologies, Industries, Our Work, About Us, Insights, **Contact**. I click it.

The Contact page loads with a clean heading: **"Ready to Build Something Great?"** and the subtext: *"Complete the form below to tell us about your project. We will get in touch with you as soon as possible."* Direct. Clear. No ambiguity about what happens next.

The contact form itself is simple — five fields:

1. **First Name** (required)
2. **Last Name** (required)
3. **Company Email** (required)
4. **Company** (required)
5. **How Can We Help You?** (required — open text)

That's it. No "select your budget range" dropdown. No "how did you hear about us" question. No "what services are you interested in" multi-select that would require me to know their terminology. Just tell them who I am and what I need. I could write something like: *"Our board is pushing us to explore AI adoption for our logistics and distribution operations. We're a mid-size company (~600 employees) and we're looking for a consulting partner who can help us understand where AI makes sense for our business. Interested in your AI Opportunity Workshop."*

I notice there's what appears to be a CAPTCHA iframe below the form fields, which is fine for security, though those can sometimes be tricky with my wrist issues if they require clicking tiny images.

Below the form, there's a testimonials carousel with a quote from Patrick West, Vice President of Apex Leaders: *"I think everybody here has been really impressed and really happy with where the app is going. We trust that any crazy idea we cook up, you guys can really digest and say how it can be feasible, which is great."* That's a natural, candid testimonial — not polished corporate speak. It makes the company feel approachable.

Further down the Contact page, under a heading **"Let's Connect,"** they provide three additional contact methods:

1. **Email:** contact@launchpadlab.com
2. **Call:** (312) 888-9651
3. **Connect with Us on LinkedIn**

I appreciate having all three options. The email and phone number are clearly displayed, not hidden. If I wanted to, I could pick up the phone right now and call. The phone number is a Chicago area code, which makes them feel local and real — not some faceless offshore operation.

Beyond the dedicated Contact page, I noticed that **contact forms appear at the bottom of virtually every page I visited** — the homepage ("Let's Build Something Great"), the AI Automation page ("Ready to Unlock ROI with AI?"), the Our Work page ("Ready to Build Something Great?"), and the About Us page. This persistent form presence means that no matter where I am on the site, I'm never more than a scroll away from reaching out. That's good design.

The homepage also had a prominent **"Connect with an Expert"** button right in the hero section, which links directly to the contact page. And the AI Automation page had a **"Book an AI Automation Assessment"** button that links to a workshop booking page. So there are multiple pathways to engagement, each tailored to where I am in my decision-making process.

In the footer of every page, their address (**2045 W Grand Ave Ste B PMB 37406, Chicago, Illinois 60612**) and phone number are displayed, along with links to Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

**Summary:** Finding how to contact them was essentially effortless. The "Contact" label in the navigation is unmissable. The form is simple and non-intimidating. They offer email, phone, and social media alternatives. And the persistent contact forms throughout the site ensure I never have to hunt for a way to reach out. If anything, the contact mechanisms are almost too ubiquitous — every page ends with a form — but I'd rather have too many options than too few.

### Overall Experience Summary

**Who I am and what I needed:** I'm Margaret Chen, a 54-year-old CEO of a logistics company. I'm not technical. I wear progressive lenses and deal with wrist strain. My board is pushing me to explore AI, and I need a technology partner who speaks my language — business outcomes, not engineering jargon.

**Did the site meet my needs?**

Largely, yes. LaunchPad Lab's website is one of the more accessible technology consulting sites I've encountered. Here's what worked and what didn't:

**What worked well:**

- **Business-outcome language throughout.** The site leads with "Results that Matter," "reduce costs," "unlock growth," "operational efficiency" — not with technical specifications. I felt like the site was speaking to me, the CEO, not to my (hypothetical) CTO.
- **Clear navigation.** Seven items in the nav bar, all clearly labeled. "Contact" is exactly where I expect it. "Our Work" clearly means case studies. No mystery.
- **Credible social proof.** Logos from Harvard, Whirlpool, MD Anderson, Kawasaki, and others. These aren't cherry-picked startup logos — they're major institutions. The 240+ clients and 90% retention rate are compelling.
- **Structured AI approach.** The four-phase AI engagement model (Workshop → Proof of Concept → Production → Optimization) is exactly the kind of risk-mitigated, phased approach I could present to my board. The free workshop as an entry point lowers the barrier dramatically.
- **Simple contact form.** Five fields. No jargon. No dropdowns requiring me to self-categorize. Multiple ways to reach out (form, email, phone, LinkedIn).
- **Case studies with real numbers.** "$1M+ new annual revenue," "90% reduction in training time," "60%+ reduction in repetitive manual work." These are the metrics that matter in a board presentation.
- **The "Problems We Solve" table on the AI page.** Mapping pain points to solutions in plain language was the single most effective piece of content on the entire site for me.

**What could be improved:**

- **Some jargon remains.** Terms like "agentic AI," "cross-functional teams," "agile," "bespoke," "full digital product lifecycle," "bi-weekly sprint releases," "UAT validation," "data pipelines," "your stack," and "UI/UX that converts and boosts CSAT" are either unfamiliar or vaguely understood. For a non-technical audience, a brief plain-English explanation alongside these terms would help.
- **No explicit "Logistics" or "Supply Chain" industry mention.** The Industries section in the nav dropdown lists Financial Services, Healthcare, Professional Services, Insurance, Technology, Legal, Private Equity, Education, and Social Impact. There's no "Manufacturing," "Logistics," "Distribution," or "Supply Chain" category. I had to find Kawasaki and American Truck Business Services by scanning the full case study list. Adding more industry categories — or at least a more prominent "and more" indicator — would help executives in underrepresented sectors feel included.
- **Text size and contrast concerns.** Some of the smaller text elements — particularly the "Learn More" links on the service cards and the descriptive paragraphs under section headings — required me to adjust my progressive lenses carefully. My eyes strained slightly reading some of the lighter-weight body copy. Slightly larger base font size or higher contrast would help users like me.
- **Carousel navigation.** The case study carousel on the homepage uses small dot buttons to navigate between slides. These tiny circular buttons are difficult targets for someone with wrist discomfort. I'd prefer larger navigation arrows or the ability to simply scroll through the case studies.
- **The word "Agentforce" is used frequently without context.** On the AI Automation page and elsewhere, "Agentforce" appears to be a Salesforce product name, but it took me a while to understand that. To a non-technical reader, it initially reads like a made-up marketing buzzword.
- **The contact form's CAPTCHA.** I noticed an iframe that appears to be a CAPTCHA verification. While I understand the need for spam prevention, CAPTCHAs that require clicking small image tiles can be physically challenging for someone with wrist strain and visually challenging for someone with progressive lenses.

**Would I reach out?**

Yes, I would. Despite the minor friction points, this site gave me enough confidence that LaunchPad Lab understands business problems — not just technology problems. The free AI Opportunity Workshop is exactly the low-commitment entry point I need. I could bring my COO and my head of operations into that workshop and let the LaunchPad Lab team assess where AI could help us. The case studies prove they've delivered real results for real companies. The phased approach means I'm not committing to a massive contract upfront.

I would fill out the contact form, mention the AI Workshop, and ask specifically about their experience with logistics and distribution companies. If the response is prompt, personal, and jargon-free, they'd make my shortlist.

**Final rating:** 8 out of 10. Professional, credible, and mostly accessible to a non-technical business executive. Small improvements in jargon reduction, font size, and industry representation would push this to a 9.
